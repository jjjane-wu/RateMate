"I have to admit, this is the largest purschase I have ever made on Amazon and it is for a used product.  I've only bought two things before Amazon Renewed with one great and the other I had to return (non were computer).  This review is really different for me because it is more of a review of the seller than the product itself because if the product is as advertised then I know it is a good product.  I know that because this replaces an 11 yr old MacBook.  A laptop that can last that long brings buyer loyalty.<br /><br />Now for the review.  The MacBook looks virtually brand new.  The only blemish is on the top of the screen that is a small scratch.  It's not in the pixel area, but in the black-out area, so no problem for me at all.  I've already loaded the newest OS and loaded my time machine from the old MacBook.  Evertyhing is working great.  The charger is not an Apple charger, but I already knew that would likely be the case.<br /><br />If anything changes I will update this review.

"This laptop is definitely the best MBP to date. The display is incredible, the processor is great as always, and the little details such as the speakers, sleek design, thinness, and lightness are huge plusses. And I must mention separately the AMAZING SSD! It's LIGHTNING fast!!!<br /><br />And to top all of that-- the touchbar is a great addition. I use it often for scrubbing through video and audio and doing menu shortcuts.  It's so smooth to use and really responsive. I believe Apple went the right direction on this because I found a vertical touchscreen to be awkward to use, especially when there's a highly responsive and intuitive trackpad right below it. Plus, it prevents smudges on the screen.<br /><br />On USB-C: I had to spend about $80 on dongles (2 USB adapters, 2 Display adapters, and a USB-C to lightning. You just have to look around. I personally love being able to charge my computer from any port, as it prevents the cable from bending excessively. This feature alone is worth the price I had to pay for dongles. ANOTHER PLUS: Apple now sells the charging cable and adapter separately, so if you do break your cable it only costs $20 to replace, not $80 (thank goodness)! You can also buy any USB-C cable to charge, you don't have to buy Apple's cables (though I would recommend it).<br /><br />There are a few cons, though. Graphics could be better for a laptop this expensive. Gamers should NOT buy the Radeon Pro 450, I could only get 20-25 FPS on Cities: Skylines, which is admittedly not optimized for the OS but this was at the highest GFX settings anyway.  I will note though, compared to a 2013 13&#34; MBP with integrated graphics, the difference is still worlds better. Make no mistake.<br />Battery life is okay, though I've only ever seen 10 hours of battery life if I only do a low-key task for that long. It's certainly not horrible as long as you update the OS as soon as you set it up. Finally, the keyboard takes a little getting used to. It's louder than the last gen, so you'll have to learn to use a softer keystroke.<br /><br />Overall, this laptop is great! Apple made the right call not adding a touch screen, and they certainly compensated for that decision with a larger trackpad (which has great palm rejection) and the intuitive touch bar. Ports are not as big of a deal as everyone says, and this laptop is NOT FOR GAMERS, but great for everything else.",0.82,1020.03,0.2524750830564784,0.47372412187510793,Macbook

"The set up of this laptop was a complete disaster!! It came with a security remote management program tied to it that was uncrackable on my end. I contacted the seller and they were not helpful at all. Their only solution was for me to return the laptop even when I told them that was not what I wanted to do.

I have had it for about a week now and so far so good. It arrived faster than it was expected, the cosmetic damage to the laptop is okay, there is a large dent/gouge on one of the edges that is pretty significant.

It looks fine, the only way I noticed was when I look at the bottom of the laptop I expected to find model #s so I could buy a compatible case for the laptop and there is nothing on the bottom of the laptop what so ever.

The A key on the keyboard sticks a bit from time to time, otherwise functionality, speed, and battery life have been good so far.

I love everything about my new Macbook and I obviously immediately noticed a huge difference in it‚Äôs performance. I am extremely happy about my screen size too from 13‚Äù to 16‚Äù. It‚Äôs definitely worth having a bigger screen especially if you are a graphic designer like myself.",0.9400000000000001,1999.0,0.3194805194805195,0.44174025974025977,Macbook

"I bought this new Macbook Pro 15&quot; with Touch Bar from Apple.com. I have been using it for a few days and I have only one word to say &quot;AMAZING&quot;. I am an avid Apple user and have a few Apple devices like iPad Pro 9.7&quot;, iPhone 4s, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s plus, iPhone 7 plus, iPhone SE, and now this to provide some context.<br /><br />Overview: This particular model which I have (Maxed-out except SSD), 16GB RAM, 2.9GHz quad-core Intel Core i7, Radeon Pro 460 with 4GB, 256GB SSD) is definitely a Pro machine. I would highly recommend this machine to people looking for an excellent replacement for their previous pro generation models with great screen.<br /><br />Design: This machine is typical Apple it is well designed with a thin and light form factor. It is a truly gorgeous looking machine. It is 3.3kgs according to the box and much less weight for a pro i7 and dedicated GPU machine like this. The chassis is very compact for the size of the machine overall.<br /><br />Display: I admit I am a screen noob and don't know much about the screen machanics and people say it's the same resolution like previous models  but this screen is quite gorgeous the color is great and more brighter and definitely welcome if you have iPad Pro 9.7 and iPhone 7 plus which also have this color gamut. The colors are rich. This thing is eye piercing bright. Much brighter then any other laptop I have ever used. Overall it is great having the extra real-estate of the larger screen when compared to the 13‚Äù Macbook.<br /><br />Keyboard: I love the new keyboard and the loud clicky sound it produces. I know this is a user specific thing and so try it out but give it a chance because in my experience it took me a few days to get used to. This is similar in that it has much less travel then the older MBP. The larger keys are also easier to make less mistakes on. There is something satisfying about the sound though.<br /><br />Touch Pad: Great but it's HUGE. I wish they would have made Apple pencil compatibility that would have been quite awesome. I think the touch bar  will be quite useful in the long run as more applications will be made in the coming months maybe I‚Äôll be proved wrong over time but the placement seems good once you use it.<br /><br />Speed: This machine is fast if you are looking at it compared to an Air or a 12‚Äù machine. The SSD screams and the package overall is excellent for the right consumer.<br /><br />Price: So the elephant in the room is price. This is about $500 north of obnoxious pricing. I think it is a fine machine and I love it personally but I had a feel of being gouged a bit by Apple at $3,000. When compared to the previous pro well that is a bit odd because that machine is really old when you look at it the screen alone is ancient and the touch bar so basically we are paying this much for the touchbar and you can get the same hardware in other brands but again Apple is Apple you can't compare Apple with any other brand in terms of creativity and customer service<br /><br />I do recommend this machine to the right consumer. Namely to a previous MacBook Pro user or anyone who was looking to buy a Dell XPS or any other premium machine from any other brand, a person looking for a great screen, battery life, faster SSD and something new and this will last 3-5 years, Go for this one you will not be disappointed at all.<br /><br />The only small gripe I have is that it doesn‚Äôt come in the range of colors like rose gold or even new colors to attract more customers. It is a small minor thing but oh well don't forget the extra dongles we need for everything we get Four Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports and can't even connect our iPhone 7 plus with this new machine but again people will get used to it as we got with the headphone jack not being there on the iPhone 7 and USB-C is the future that's why Apple is doing this.<br /><br />ATLEAST WE HAVE THE HEADPHONE JACK ON THIS MACHINE .! :P (y)<br /><br />Good Luck buying this machine and look at the pictures below to see how it looks :)",0.82,1020.03,0.18808329601433052,0.441528228354034,Macbook
"I do a lot of reviews via Amazon and many other platforms via my profession in tech. I come in contact with many sellers and products. Putting that out there, this one is a very mixed bag for me and I really hope this review will help someone out with these types of purchases in particular. This seller is ‚Äú Reuse ‚Äú .<br />  When buying used Macs , I‚Äôve learned a lot especially off of Amazon, the seller 100% makes the difference,  as well as doing your homework on them,  and the product itself. That will pay off in the end ,  know what you want , know what the price is and what it should be and know there will be a mark up and what that markup should be. The used Mac game is dirty one. There are more cons than pros and lots of gouging over trivial features especially color , I‚Äôve seen a $150 mark up over color in my opinion that‚Äôs a very dirty play, these aren‚Äôt iPhones , they are Macs , granted this seller did not do that, that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm saying  but many do.<br />  I‚Äôm my situation, I got this Space gray Mac, Mid 2018, 2.2ghz Intel 6core I-7 gpu Radeon 545 , 256SSD after tax it was about $681 no warranty offered so let‚Äôs say $700 rounded up  (this will matter later) Well , first impressions where great honestly as they actually had it boxed up very nice and the laptop was protected in a little bubble sleeve as seen in the picture , it was simplistic. It was not  crushed , beat up , and it was taken care of via delivery as well as their packing.which was a good start , so great job there. There could‚Äôve been a tad more cushion , maybe like popcorn in the bubble wrap that had it in , let‚Äôs be honest we as a consumer or a small business are spending a lot of money and the product should be protected well,  seeing as you or I just dropped $700-$1000k right ?.  So, That‚Äôs where the good impression ended unfortunately and things being great.<br />  As soon as I opened the box before I even got into booting the Mac and wiping the drive and updating the software , I was not happy with the laptop. It  looked like it has been thrown around , literally. I added a few pictures but that isn‚Äôt the worst of it As I only took a few photos for the seller to get a small visual of how bad it came and  to get a immediate refund issued. I‚Äôll touch on the conversation and customer service in a bit. The Mac looked as if was dropped on concrete (who really knows) in some spots there was  small chunks of pitting obviously from impact on a porous surface. Lots of scratches and even a decent sized dent or two. Obviously disappointment set in as it was the year and color I wanted and I was on a deadline most importantly and needed this Mac to get to work as my last Mac went down which is what brought me here in the first place .<br />  Well after boot the drive had issues in general lots of buggy behavior, updating to Ventura was a struggle for it, it came on High Sierra , (this laptop is fully capable & compatible for the newest macOS fyi without the M1/M2 chipsets) but I never even bothered to wipe or update the drive and move forward as more issues arose fast. It only has 4 type C ports . That‚Äôs it . Well one port was dead , left rear and then another had a connectivity and voltage issue. The keyboard and trackpad were about the only nice things or had a nice feel, there were scratches around the chassis and bezels of the display which was already affecting the display and would have been a issue in the future undoubtedly. SO, to basically get this moving forward the Mac was not worth the price and fairly beat up for what I paid. You expect some issues when buying used , I could live with that but not after the conversation with the seller.<br />  Now, In all fairness, this seller was not impolite nor unprofessional however they really had a take it or leave it type of attitude via our lengthy conversation that I will touch on a bit now as I don‚Äôt want to be tacky.  I would never leave screenshots or direct quotes out of respect and courtesy for people. Although the encounter left me asking over and over ‚Ä¶.what happened  to customer service ?<br />  I need to start with I let them know of  the issues and the first response was basically if you are not happy with, it send it back and sorry about your luck. Ok, fair play, I can handle that type of response.  My issue was they really tripped over what they said throughout the convo as they stated I bought a ‚Äúas is product‚Äù but it‚Äôs also listed as Amazon renewed/refurbished. HERE IS WHERE I NEED FOLKS TO PAY ATTENTION, ITS IMPORTANT.<br />  There is a disconnect between Amazon and 3rd party sellers which this was and gives a very EBay type of buying situation and that‚Äôs is a bad look for Amazon. After stating the issues and speaking to Amazon a rep named Ariana (very nice) come to find out Amazon never touched this product, nor did their quality control team , they did not see or have hands on this product , there techs that look over the product to diagnose the in this case Laptop and make sure it meets the Amazon renewed/refurbished promise never touched it, they never had it in there facility or hands to assure  everything was in working order. Amazon never saw this product. It was all handled in the store of the seller which is a 3rd party, they told me straight forward which I can appreciate honesty but the laptop wasn‚Äôt tested fully on their end and admitted. That‚Äôs a issue. They tested a port as in a single port  to make sure it charged and moved on, they didn‚Äôt test all the ports, which is a partial quote. Well there is only 4 ports I said, I‚Äôm gonna say that‚Äôs a very important overlook,  not only that,‚Ä¶ but if you didn‚Äôt bother to check all 4 ports , what else did you not check ? Did you open the laptop and check the fans , clean the dust out, make sure the board looked good,  no frayed or burned wires , no water damage, loose conductors and so on. Let‚Äôs just say it didn‚Äôt inspire a lot of confidence at this point.<br />  Now I tried to work with the seller as I bought a aftermarket extended warranty I always do or warranties when offered in house, however I  was not going to open a claim and burn my warranty on a MacBook Pro I‚Äôve had less than 5 days . I asked them ‚Äú Hey how about this , at least fix the ports and send it back and we are good , basically they said straight away  No, ‚Ä¶ ok, ‚Ä¶. next I said well how about taking some money off the top of the price , so I can get it fixed myself knowing very well even if they took $100 off , the repair was way more than that and I was willing to pay that money if they agreed as replacing a typE-C port is a expensive fix because the type c port would need replacement and sottering back on the main board. Nope. They weren‚Äôt interested l.<br />  Next,  they said I bought a product that was in ‚Äú acceptable condition‚Äù . I can‚Äôt lie , my jaw dropped , that wasn‚Äôt stated , and frankly I don‚Äôt buy items like that and take chances with high value items. This was my issue , while we spoke professional and cordial there was a problem , first not only do I document everything I do in business, again I would never buy anything other than a in ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù shape product. I even went back to the ad/posting and it does not say that via screenshots I took and the original order details and receipt anywhere . Now , many of  these stores will have those options ‚Äúused , acceptable, newish , excellent,‚Äù you get the idea, this said nothing of the sort, frustrating that they didn‚Äôt want to work with me and make it right as there was a accountability issue here , and if it was on me I would take it but it‚Äôs not , so why is Amazon and this seller passing the buck. That said ,  the bigger issue is that Amazon is putting their name on a product as it‚Äôs been refurbished by them and it‚Äôs not, basically giving their stamp of approval on products they have never seen or touched. That‚Äôs a problem.  If you read Amazon promise or the paperwork or the ad it says at the very least the laptop should be in working order all around , battery at 80% , which means a low cycle count on a Mac  , and so on, take the time to read the Amazon renewed/refurbished promise , so first tip unless it‚Äôs  truly in house from Amazon and delivered by Amazon don‚Äôt expect said product to be honored or that renewed promise to be even true for that matter and THAT is the lesson . Use the filters in the app & web , select only dealers from Amazon and delivery by Amazon as they will make it right, as to where a 3rd party seller can sell you something that was not checked properly maybe it slipped through the cracks which is still unacceptable for high priced items. They do not have to honor a thing , it‚Äôs a trial and error process at your expense, meaning having worked in repair shops years back sometimes they are very understaffed and  busy, or they have ‚Äútechs‚Äù in training or plain out just not qualified.<br />  Now , I am not bashing this seller but I was not happy with the grey area of accountability which was admitted by both the seller & Amazon. If Amazon is going to put there stamp on it , you may want to be the ones making sure what‚Äôs being sold actually works otherwise your name starts getting muddy, and to the seller you would‚Äôve been better off just fixing a laptop your going to have to fix anyway to resell it knowing it has 2 bad ports at the least and could‚Äôve kept a sale. Now we all lose. I considered doing  business again with the seller just so it‚Äôs said, only because our conversation wasn‚Äôt bad but wasn‚Äôt helpful , and how can I trust the next laptop you send will be great ,which  the last message did indeed say make sure to let them know when I make another order and they would make sure it was good to go but again, really ? Would it? And at what cost? How much more will that cost and how much more time will it take from my business.<br />  Finally , after some readjusting, I ended up finding a MacBook Pro a year newer (almost 2 years,  a late 2019) that had a faster cpu 2.6 6 core Intel up to 4.3ghz still 16 gb DDR4 a much better gpu set up  ( the dual Intel UHD graphics card built in with the PCle Radeon Pro 555x and double the SSD storage 512gb. and a 2 year warranty that covers anything for just  $100 more than what I spent here , Down side I had to get a silver and not a space gray but would  that really matter at the end of they day for you ? . So $800 and I have a 2 year old MBP that has better specs and actually backed by Amazon and there warranty THEY offer.<br />  The moral of this long review is to first realize this is going to be a crummy time trying to have a good experience even doing the tips I‚Äôm about to wrap up with, it‚Äôs the luck of the draw , if you don‚Äôt want to play this game just go to Apple and buy new, trust me, that‚Äôs the best advice if you don‚Äôt want this game.  ‚Ä¶I personally like the touchbar series Mac and they are still upgradable compared to some older models and newer models. So finally the tips , compare sellers , ask questions before you buy to the seller , read over the asked questions section , know your product and what the product is worth and maybe a 10-15% markup at most, in fairness depending on the way the seller gets their products they don‚Äôt make a lot of money on these sales, BUT  that should never affect you as a consumer. Never.<br />  Look for sellers that are 100% under Amazon‚Äôs umbrella which is getting hard but they are out there , use the filters when shopping and finally pay the money for the warranty, you are making a investment don‚Äôt cheap out on your purchase.<br />  These are the best tips I can give as my experience was NOT great with this seller and it‚Äôs a shame because this was a workable situation, it could‚Äôve been saved had they done what was right, while they were not rude , but it was very apparent they did not care very much as I sad , from the opening dialogue we had was basically you don‚Äôt  like it , return it ,then to the I bought a ‚Äú acceptable ‚Äú product, which was not stated anywhere, as I said I don‚Äôt buy those types of products,  there was only one buy option and that wasn‚Äôt  mentioned,  I pay attention and I know what I buy,which is still no excuse for the product to not work amd be beat up while having a Amazon renewed sticker on Int‚Ä¶.  I am a small businessman , I also know arguing with a seller will get you nowhere , they weren‚Äôt willing to make this mistake right or try to meet in the middle , and I tried.. SO, it cost me time and money and a client in that time lost I‚Äôm my business being I was a in a deadline and expected no issues as I don‚Äôt buy risky products, and they also lost a sale they could‚Äôve kept and honestly, a repeat customer that would have brought them a lot of business with my following that is loyal it just seemed silly to be being they will have to repair that Mac regardless and we both lost time. It was a mess of a situation that didn‚Äôt have to be .  My refund is being processed in the next day or so  and that would‚Äôve gotten done either way as the laptop truly showed up not functional and looking rough. I gave they seller the opportunity to fix it they didn‚Äôt and at least Amazon didn‚Äôt have to step in so I will give them that. This is a tricky  situation with the Amazon renewed/refurbished stamp going on these 3rd party stores, it‚Äôs becoming a issue. I have to say , although the seller Reuse were cordial, I would not recommend this seller based on the fact they are misleading in their selling tactics and ads/postings ,they knowingly sent out a product without being diagnosed properly and fully , they wasted my time and money and refused to work with me to get a functional laptop. Unfortunately this is a stay away for me folks , I have many reviews out there all over and folks know I shoot straight . Please be careful with buying and best of luck to anyone else if you take the leap . Happy Holidays.",0.8400000000000001,740.0,0.11562621390086174,0.44032947073758244,Macbook

"I think this is actually newer than the laptop my job gave me. Pretty fantastic, considering the machine I have was initially priced at $3,000-ish, and this laptop only cost a fraction of that ($1,045 as of date of purchase). No issues with the machine so far. No accounts previously installed on it. Clean install, matte silver top. If Amazon allows, I may add pictures later on. Considering getting a second laptop from TekZilla, if this is the quality of devices they ship. Because I paid $400 - $600 to get my daughter's mom a laptop that wasn't a Macbook Pro, and it is slow, because of lacking an SSD.

I was so excited to receive this today and when I got it out of the box I was pretty disappointed. The cord that it came with was an Apple cord but it had been painted with paint peeling off. The cord didn‚Äôt work either once I plugged it in which didn‚Äôt allow for the computer to turn on either. The other thing that was noticeable was the play on the hinge. It was not tight like a typical MacBook and was very wobbly. There were several dings which I expected but it looks like it had been dropped pretty hard based on the way the hinge was and some of the dents.,0.8400000000000001,271.26,-0.024458874458874454,0.4188796512293501,Macbook

"Recommend wait a few months if you need this to work as a &#34;Pro&#34; machine, need better docking solutions to make it function properly in my workspace.<br /><br />2-Stars is a direct result of a lack of support for needed adaptors to function properly and being forced to buy touchbar on 15&#34; Model. Bought this knowing that I would have to purchase adaptors, however I have been completely disappointed in Apple and device cable manufacturers for the lack of quality cables to get my machine to work. Apple should have made sure that prior to going exclusively to USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 that they had adequate adapters and docking stations to go with it. Now I have to wait Months for a Thunderbolt 3 docking station just to get this to function as needed.<br /><br />Additionally in my opinion the touch bar is a complete gimmick, and have found that it is a distraction as I prefer to focus my attention on the screen. While they did promote the touch bar as being customizable, I have found that there is very few changes you can make at this time. I'm sure in the future there will be more functionality added, I would have rather spent the extra money on a faster processor or storage capacity instead of being forced to buy it unless I wanted to downgrade to a 13&#34; slower machine. Ridiculous!<br /><br />As for other updates like touchpad, screen brightness and performance I have no complaints and would rate those 5-stars.<br /><br />One last frustration point and is more of a rant, why in the hell did they stop including the 6ft extension cable for the power brick? Without the extension cable I cannot plug this huge brick behind my desk, couch, or bed due to the size. Every MacbookPro I have bought previously (On my fifth one) has included it.

"I purchased this computer about 2 weeks ago as of this writing and have been using it regularly as my daily workhorse. I purchased it from Apple's website with additional upgrades, including the CPU, graphics, and disk upgrades, and picked it up at an Apple storefront.<br /><br />I have long loved the MacBook line for its consistency, ease of use, and standard of quality over everything else. Price has always been high for Apple's computers, but such price has always been justified in my mind by the fantastic quality of Apple's machines and software. I'm still blown away by this machine's build quality & hardware--they are excellent.<br /><br />However, the systems's software/OS is riddled with bugs to the point where it has become a pain to use. When the computer has been asleep for an extended period of time, it dies. Booting it back up displays a prompt that &#34;something went wrong&#34; and asks me to send a report to Apple. Occasionally when booting up the computer or waking it from sleep, the display is completely garbled or the computer just freezes, and I'm forced to hard reset it. I've lost open, unsaved work this way, and it's changed the way I think about working and leaving work open when on this computer. The first time I ever opened this MacBook after taking it out of the box, the screen turned on to a garbled, colored mess that looked like the screen itself was broken, and the computer was frozen. I actually had to hard reboot the computer immediately this first time I ever turned it on.<br /><br />Other oversights by Apple's software teams have included clearing data after a system update, like deleting all saved fingerprints used to unlock the computer. The touch ID feature is also beginning to reveal itself as gimmicky and underutilized. It is used only in very specific situations--to unlock a computer from sleep (which I don't get to use anyway, since going to sleep typically means the computer crashes). Other obvious use cases, such as using it for logging into the computer when it first boots up or as password entry method when installing software are non-existent. But those oversights are mere irritations.<br /><br />I am so disappointed in this product, but more importantly I am frustrated and angry with having to deal with all of its odd bugs on a regular and predictable basis. After using this product for two weeks as my daily driver, it isn't the keyboard or lack of standard USB ports or anything else that people have worried about that has gotten in my way. Instead, it's the absolute terrible software that make this computer a challenge to use. I have always loved Apple's computers, but I don't believe I will purchase another. If there was an alternative high-quality Linux-based machine on the market today, I would return this computer in a heartbeat. The price point is absurd for the lack of quality I have experienced, and I would encourage the reader to look elsewhere for a computer.",0.82,1020.03,-0.03651515151515151,0.329229004589293,Macbook

"I had to reset my computer almost immediately after I set it up due to a corrupt file in a program I downloaded(maya3d) its a safe program but I hadn't figured out yet that all I needed to do was reset the preferences. Also considering other factors after what I found out. I had looked at the specs before hand and everything had matched up with what the seller had posted on amazon. Unfortunately, after the reset I noticed the set up was a bit different than the first time and once it was finished I took a look at the specs again. I noticed that the previous AMD Radeon Pro 555X graphics title had been replaced with an Intel UHD Graphics 630 1536 MB. A big reason why I bought this specific computer was for portable (entry level)3d modeling and the graphics card information is very important. The fact that they lied about the specs is enough reason to return it. On top of that they used a program to cover their lie as well. The even more unfortunate part is that I need this laptop for school and work and this is literally so frustrating. no wonder they keep lowering the price of the laptop on amazon.

It was plugged in and powered for most of the last 9.5 months, but that seems too short for electronics like this, so I'm giving a poor rating.",0.8800000000000001,,0.07166666666666667,,Macbook
"This mac mini is great. I had a great experience with apple products after using the macbook air. This mac mini is actually as fast as the mac book air 2010, considering that the macbook air has a solid state hard, and the mac mini does not.<br /><br />In my experience this mac is fast. It  can easily open up adobe after effects, photoshop elements, and iMovie.

"My husband and I have been devoted Mac users for years and have owned at least 8 Apple computers and several Apple peripherals. Quite frankly I didn't think we would be writing any adverse review for any Apple product. But here I am doing just that and simply stated I would recommend that any of you considering this MacBook and who also rely heavily on wireless connectivity for your laptop to delay your purchase indefinitely until Apple has resolved an inherent wireless connectivity problem with OS 10.5.5.<br /><br />I use this MacBook as my kitchen work station and rely completely on our wireless LAN (Apple Airport) as I have no ethernet port in the kitchen area of our house.  I am now experiencing numerous drop outs of both my internet connection and my LAN and this started after upgrading to Apple's OS 10.5.5 which appears to be the version that now comes installed on this laptop.<br /><br />In reviewing numerous posts on Apple's ""support"" web-site it is clear that a significant population of other users of this same MacBook have the identical wireless connectivity problem with OS 10.5.5 and have been asking, pleading for help from Apple, e.g., that Apple fix their faulty software as in put it back through a full SQT. What we seem to have received is a Beta version they foisted on their customer base for debugging. I have yet to find anything on Apple's web-site offered by Apple that remotely addresses this problem.<br /><br />Although otherwise this MacBook is an excellent performer, in this day and age there is an absolute need for reliable laptop wireless connectivity. Therefore we are very disappointed in this product's wireless performance as well as Apple's apparent lack of concern for their loyal customer base. After all, what good is a laptop with random wireless connectivity?  One day of this failure mode is one day too many and It is doubtful we will purchase another Apple computer until our confidence in their quality and customer responsiveness is restored. At the very least Apple should issue a statement admitting to the problem, indicating they are attempting to resolve the problem and specify a planned date for its resolution.<br /><br />In the meantime buyer BEWARE of the Apple MacBook MB404LL/A 13.3-inch Laptop (2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Processor, 2 GB RAM, 250 GB Hard Drive) Black which is an expensive laptop that offers worthless wireless performance!!",0.82,,-0.10802083333333334,,Macbook

"When I went to pick up my iPad the opening week this past year, I knew, like most of my other products I bought from Apple (iPhone, iPod Touch, MacBook etc..) that I am going to want to get a case.<br /><br />And of course, being a new product, a lot of companies weren't out on the market with their personal take on a case, so Apple had their own brand made, which is the case in question.<br /><br />I liked it at first, it gave it a professional look, but similar to what other people stated, it gave a weird feel to the iPad. You had to hold a certain way to interact with the iPad and showing other people. It only tilts so much, that you're better off sitting upright using the tilt function, because laying down, or any other position, it was pointless.<br /><br />Then, that professional look I was talking about? That all went out the window, because after a few weeks of house, the way the material is on the case itself, it picked up finger prints, dust, and all other kinds of stuff. And it's not very easy to clean off either.<br /><br />Pretty much in short, for us early adopters, this was our only option for a while, but now, with Xmas under way, and the iPad having a few months under it's belt, you're better off getting something else. There's tons of nice portfolio's, packs, slip cases, skins etc for it, that you'll be alright finding a good fit for you",0.86,,0.11781543109668109,,Macbook
"I'm a PC/Mac Technician/Administrator by trade. So I have plenty or experience with Windows and Macs. I've used PCs since there were PCs and I always say I'll use the best tool for the job, and time after time the best tool is a Mac. Whether you're an aspiring programmer, designer, artist, musician or simply just want to surf the web, view e-mail, IM friends or and get your job done easily, a Mac will suit your needs.<br /><br />I bought this model refurbished off the Apple Store. Anything I say about the computer's Operating System (OS X) usually applies equally to other Macintosh models.<br /><br />First the Hardware:<br />For a consumer machine it's surprisingly solid and the weight feels good. The built in camera (standard on Mac laptops and iMacs) is pretty decent as far as web cams go. After months of heavy use the hinges are still snug and the screen is just as bright. 2GB will take care of most people's needs.<br />Also, and this is very important, since this is an Intel based machine you can install windows (or run Parallels, Fusion or Crossover) if you have one or two legacy Apps that you absolutely can't do without. A PC can't run OS X or any of its great applications, but a Mac can run Windows right along side Mac OS program with Parallels, VMWare Fusion or Crossover.<br /><br />So, if you're trying to decide between a Mac for OS X and the easy of use I talk about below and a PC for old Windows programs, you can choose both by buying this or any Intel based Mac (which is all shipping models).<br /><br />The Hardware is simply top notch. In its stock configuration you can do anything 99% of computer users do. And with a third party app, you can do the last 1%. OS X is Unix. Then you have the Mac OS (OS X) and you have he option of running Windows. So, really Macs these days are THE machine IT professionals are turning to in droves.<br /><br />The Software (is what makes Macs shine):<br />OS X is extremely stable. It is a Unix OS, so advanced users can easily do anything from a command line they can do on any Unix system from a command line using the terminal application. If you don't understand the previous sentence you don't have to because the user interface as easy or easier than Windows and you never have to learn complex commands to unleash the power of the system.<br /><br />The only time I reboot is when I install software that requires a reboot. (Currently My Uptime is over 21 days -- since I installed an OS Update, and I have no doubt the system could remain on for months without needing a reboot). That's almost unheard of in Windows land, where often the machine chokes on some process and the only option is a reboot.<br /><br />You can't mess up the system by clicking the wrong button, or putting the wrong file in the trash -- OS X doesn't allow that and requires an administrator password to change any important settings.<br /><br />Adding Users is as simple as clicking a new account button, typing in their name and a password. Then you can switch users with a click and be secure in the knowledge that your kids or grandma can't mess up the system or your settings (because they'll have their own set), or applications.<br /><br />The system is very secure out of the box, and configuring to server web pages is a simple click and drag documents into a folder and flip the Sharing panel switch on. There's a built in Firewall that's extreme easy to configure. Wireless performance is top notch. There is zero downside to buying this machine.<br /><br />Installing Applications is often a simple process of clicking and dragging the application into any folder or subfolder you want. Uninstalling is a simple matter of dragging thhe program, or program folder into the trash. No messy registry, no dicey uninstall apps that might delete a shared DLL, nothing like that at all.<br /><br />Adding Other hardware to the machine is also a simple process of double clicking an installer (if it's even needed) and plugging in he hardware. You never experience hardware conflicts like you do in Windows. You just plug it in and it works.<br /><br />If you've never used a computer or want to migrate from Windows or another Operating System, a Macintosh is an excellent choice. I've never had a person I recommended a Mac to come back and say, ""This was a mistake, "" or ""I hate it"" or ""I can't figure out how to use it."" They usually thank me and gleefully tell me they never realized using (and even administrating) a computer could be so easy.<br /><br />Mac VS. PC (Real world stories):<br />I HAVE had many, many people come back to me after purchasing a Windows only Machine against my advice months or years later regretting it. They didn't realize a Windows based computer would be so much work, or that it wouldn't be reliable.<br /><br />Windows XP is a bear to manage and Vista is the same bear, but just in a shiny coat with a bow. And all you can get on new computers these days is Vista. And I have yet to run into anyone, technician or layman, who even likes Vista. Sure you can downgrade to XP, but you have ot make sure there's XP drivers available for your system before you downgrade it, because if not, you'll end up with Audio or Wireless not working, and have to put Vista back on. A friend went through this exact experience.<br /><br />There are some quality PC makers out there, but most are junk. If you're wondering why the MacBook costs hundreds of dollars more than a PC, remember, you get what you pay for. The margins Apple makes for a Mac are comparable to what PC manufacturers make nowadays. So, realize that most PC manufacturers are using cheaper (read ""low quality"") parts, and they're going to fail a lot sooner than a typical Mac would.<br /><br />Viruses and Security:<br />Windows is way behind the Mac when it comes to security and virus prevention. Microsoft's solution was to pop up a dialog box for anything and everything a virus might do to try to gain control of a Windows PC. The effect: annoying the hell out of users. The OS X way: run in a mode where only things such as installing applications will bother the user. That and only check the first time if someone wants to run a new application. Once that's done the OS gets out of your way and let's you get your work done. Also, if this sounds too open, you can tighten down security simply by checking boxes in most cases. If you want to secure your machine's network connections even more try Lil Snitch.<br /><br />Caveats:<br />Almost all computers will have problems. The Mac is no exception. You might get a lemon, but apple's return policy is great. With Applecare you're covered for the practical usable life of the computer (3 years).  A hard rive might die on you: that's where backing up comes in. Backup your data. The more important, the more often you should backup. Other than that most Mac problems are simple and might just require a setting change or (at worst) a reinstall of the application. With Windows you might have to reinstall the OS and each and every application. For software and hardware problems Apple's tech support is top notch. If something needs ot be replaced -- like a bad LCD (which is rarer and rarer these days), you'll often have the machine back in a few days if you choose to ship it in for repair. Just get Applecare with your system and you'll be set.<br /><br />The Bottom Line:<br />Macs are far superior to PCs. Take it from a guy who makes money off of repairing computers. If this is to be your first computer, you probably couldn't make a better choice. If you're a Windows user considering a sea change, you couldn't pick a better time to do it -- especially considering that with a third party App you can still run Windows apps if you want to. And believe me you won't want to after experiencing the level of usability of the standard OS X application. And if you're one of those RARE Mac users considering saving money, and thinks computers are all the same: save your sanity and not just a couple of bucks, and turn away from Sony, Dell or HP.",0.82,,0.1483843359705429,,Macbook
Excellent item!!! Just what I needed for my MacBook,0.8800000000000001,,1.0,,Macbook
"I previously owned a Late 2011 13&#34; MacBook Pro and an 11&#34; MacBook Air Early 2016. The Macbook Pro was my main machine and the MacBook Air was something that I got at a great price. I thought that I would favor the MacBook Pro, but as I used the MacBook Air I began to appreciate the design philosophy of it more and more. The MacBook Pro seemed to be a cement brick next to the Air, and so I began to favor the Air because I find myself moving around with my laptops more and more. Portability has become very important to me. I loved the Air, and surprisingly enough I even liked the smaller form factor. It was easy to move, about the same size as my iPad Air 2 with a ClamCase, and it was a full computer.<br /><br />I fantasized about getting the 13&#34; Air only because of the inferior display on the 11&#34;. I had to get a custom color profile to be able to use it properly. Still, after that it became my go to device as it was small and fast. In the end, I sold it because it only came with 128GB of storage, which is paltry considering the 13&#34; MacBook Pro had 750GB of space and I was almost full on that.<br /><br />When the MacBook originally came out I was one of the detractors of it. That was because the idea behind it was a bit harder to ascertain right away. My thoughts, especially considering the specs, were that the MacBook Air was much better of a value. The new MacBook is a bit of a niche device. It won't be apparent why you may want to try it right away. I wanted to get a 15&#34; MacBook Pro with a Retina display, but the price of the one that I wanted was a bit high, given the fact that that computer is way more machine than I need to have for the price.<br /><br />While I wanted a new computer the MacBook Pro I had was still fine; I mainly wanted newer features like the Bluetooth 4.0, the ability to do handoff with apps, the retina display, and so forth. When I purchased this MacBook, it was the new updated model (second version). I would not have wanted the first one, but the upgrades made to the 2016 version made it far more attractive. It comes with 512GB of flash storage, which is not as much as the 1TB I wanted but far less expensive. Also, it is more of a standard size. I became a fan of flash storage when I had the MacBook Air, and I don't want to use any computer that does not have Flash storage now!<br /><br />This MacBook is the gold version, which I got to match my gold iPhone 6 Plus and my gold iPad Air 2. Every version looks good, and the newest color is the rose gold one. I also got the version with the m5 dual core processor for more power. The MacBook comes with 8GB of memory standard, and that is more than enough with the flash storage. One negative with this laptop and pretty much all of Apple's current and future laptops is that they are moving towards soldering the RAM and the storage to the logic board so that they are no longer user-upgradeable. That means that you must buy what you want as far as those things go as you cannot upgrade them later.<br /><br />The MacBook has a 12&#34; Retina Display, which is gorgeous. The neat thing is that the MacBook and the 11&#34; MacBook Air have the same size chassis. The MacBook is able to get a 12&#34; display onto the same chassis as the 11&#34; by reducing the size of the bezel. I like the size of the 11' MacBook Air so that is a plus for me. In terms of size, the 12&#34; MacBook puts the Air to shame. I did not think any computer could be lighter than the Air, but boy was I wrong. The Air is like a brick compared to the size of the MacBook. I can easily lift it and carry it with one hand only. It is feather light but still very sturdy.<br /><br />The keyboard uses the new butterfly mechanism which does fatigue your fingers when you first start using it, but as you get used to the way it works it becomes very easy to use. The main thing is that the keys require minimal effort to push, so you need to learn to press them very lightly. The keys are full-sized and backlit. The speakers on the new MacBook are surprisingly good. I am always nervous when I see a speaker grille below the monitor as most are not good, but the speakers are clear and loud.<br /><br />The other controversy about the MacBook is the single USB-C port. Yes, they could have tried to put another on, but given the way they had to engineer the laptop to get it to be so small and light, concessions had to be made somewhere and the port was it. The USB-C port is the only port to connect any peripherals (other than a 3.5 mm headphone jack), so you have to use it to charge the laptop as well as to connect anything like a USB cable or anything like that. You can easily get an adapter that allows you to connect more than one thing at a time, but they are somewhat pricey. As the USB-C technology (which is good and I like it very much) becomes more common, the cost should go down. At first I was very annoyed by this but as time went on, I have adjusted to the single port. I find that now I am able to understand that this laptop is more for those who want maximum portability, and for those who want a device to use mainly with wireless/bluetooth accessories and cloud services.<br /><br />The force touch trackpad seems a bit gimmicky to me. I almost never use the deep press option, but I can see how it would be useful. Perhaps there will be more configuration options that make it more useful, but for now I am using the trackpad as I always have. The MacBook does have a pretty low resolution camera. I don't film videos on my MacBook or use it for anything other than basic Facetime and such, so that does not bother me. There are some people who are heartbroken that the camera is not full HD, but the camera is not heavy duty due to the way the MacBook is designed. To make it the thinnest and lightest, that was one concession that had to be made.<br /><br />There are many concerns about the performance of the laptop. The first version had a few performance issues that made it a hard recommendation, but the 2016 upgrade has minimized those issues. I have run Parallels (2 Windows VMs) at the same time I was streaming YouTube videos and I was able to jump between them with little issues. I have had it freeze on me twice, and there have been some hangs, but nothing that has not happened to me on either the MacBook Pro or Air. I think that there has been a lot of misinformation about what this laptop can handle. Make no mistake, this is not a workstation. Yes, you can use some powerful programs on it, but it is not meant to be a heavy duty machine. The average user will have no problems with it in terms of performance. I have heard of people using auto CAD software on it without any issue. I also ran Final Cut and Logic Pro on it, and while it does take a bit of time to process and render with those programs it is more than capable of running them without a catastrophe. The processor was chosen because the MacBook is a fanless laptop, so they had to pick a processor that would not overheat without active cooling. It means that the processor is less powerful, but it still works.<br /><br />In short, the design philosophy behind the MacBook is that it is mean to be the most powerful and lightest ultrabook that it can be. It had to balance power, performance, price, storage, and features to get there, and so the result is a machine that does not seem to follow the obvious design options as any other laptop available. If you can open your mind, however, this laptop can be exactly what you need. More and more people have began loving it, and even I myself have warmed up to it. I used to wonder if I should go back to my MacBook Pro, but now I am more than satisfied with this one. I had the chance to get a MacBook Pro 15&#34; and decided against it as now that I am familiar with this laptop, given the price, features, and how I use it, the MacBook Pro would have been unnecessary. Many tech reviewers now state this is their daily driver for anything that is not hardware intensive, and I am right with them. I love the MacBook and I am glad that I gave it a try. If you can allow yourself to give it a try I would recommend it because you may find that it is a better option for you than you think.",0.86,,0.17918086543086542,,Macbook

"I have the earlier black macbook 2.16ghz/1gb/160gb and it has been solid and an exceptional computer since i upgraded from a powerbook g4 1gz titanium that was over 4yo.  A lot of people complain about macs being too expensive, but if you know anything about apple, they target a specific market who can afford to pay for their premium computers.  if you complain that they cost too much, its usually a windows person who are used to paying $500 for a crappy laptop that eventually craps out or is overrun with viruses to a point where nothing works anymore.  Another thing that people don't realize is macs retain their value VERY well.  I sold my powerbook g4 1ghz titanium for $550 in oct 2007 which originally cost $3k in 11/02(i bought it used for $500 in 12/05).  It was still in great condition with no problems when i sold it... it was as fast as my old p4 2.53ghz desktop which has been gathering dust for a while now(i had been a windows user for nearly a decade).<br /><br />This is my current setup:<br /><br />Black Macbook 2.16ghz/3gb ram/160gb hd/superdrive w/ OSX 10.5.5<br />westinghouse 24"" LCD monitor @ 1920x1200<br />fantom drive 250gb firewire external hd<br />western digital passport 320gb usb external hd<br />pinnacle hdtv stick for mac(hdtv tuner)<br />logitech wireless keyboard & mouse<br /><br />As you can see i have my macbook plugged in with a lot of accessories and i run 7+ programs at once when im using my mac, including eyetv(hdtv), isight cam w/ sightspeed video conferencing, as well as other less intensive applications.  If you want a great dependable and quick mac this is the one to get, especially now that you can find it at discounted prices since the new macbooks came out.  The only con that I have is that my old mac has the old 950GMA integrated graphics which can be an issue if you like to play/edit/encode high res videos or play graphic intensive games, especially full hd 1920P.  I can play 1920P videos fine but it will get bogged down if im using a lot of other cpu intensive programs.  im sure this won't be an issue for the majority of users since those people would probably get the macbook pro instead.  i have had no issues at all that people have complained about(fans, cracked plastic, screen flicker, etc) and im sure i'll use this mac for another 2-3years before upgrading again.<br /><br />pros:<br />fast, lightweight, long battery life<br />cons:<br />slow graphics chip",0.82,,0.11445108984582673,,Macbook

"Well up to the point at which I bought my first Mac, I was definitely a PC but now I know what I've been missing. Apple have been on the rise over the past few years thanks to their wonderful invention of the iPod. There's no doubting that the mass media attention surrounding Apple thanks to the iPod has lead to an increase in sales of the Mac. Honestly, that's the reason I decided to get a Mac when my last Windows laptop broke and I've not looked back.<br /><br />Aesthetically, the Macs are just gorgeous to look at both on the outside and in the operating system software. That is Apples biggest selling point, make it simple and make it pretty. Pretty it is, but at first simple it is not. Having been a user of Windows software since I've been able to use a computer, getting used to the Max operating system created a learning curve which I couldn't be bothered with at the time. It really is so easy that I felt like a pro using it within about half an hour.<br /><br />Thanks to the 2GB Ram of my laptop the transission between programs is almost flawless and because I generally don't do that much on my computers anyway, just word processing and the likes, I have noticed almost no lag in the running of the programs. The laptop itself is light, sturdy and just very durable as it has been knocked about a bit.<br /><br />Battery life is around 4 hours on low power mode which is very, very impressive as I generally need to use this to do work outside the home without the absence of an electrical output. Because the AC adaptor of my model connects magnetically, I have to say that it's a very very cool feature but worry about how long it will last before the magnet decides not to attach itself to my laptop.<br /><br />It does come in a few different colours, (Black, Silver, White) and silver would get the recommendation from me as it just seems fitting and better looking overall. The processor works perfectly and as mentioned before there is pretty much no lag in switching between programs. Virus possibilities are almost non-existent as it's very rare that virus's are made to attack Mac software so there's no need for virus detection software.<br /><br />There is little to no need to update your Mac software as it's top of the range when you buy it and genuinely ahead of the market. The load and shut down times are almost half of any Windows PC making that even more appealing as if you need to get to your work quickly, you can. It doesn't generate any large amount of heat from the processor so you can place the laptop in sleep mode and leave it overnight without the worry of overheating.<br /><br />If you want to look cool in Starbucks then you should buy one of these, and if you want to do your work with little difficulty, then you should buy it.

"My MacBook is my second Mac - my first was a 20"" iMac G4 that lasted me four years and was still working fine when I sold it.  My wife also had a iBook G4.<br /><br />I use a PC all day at work, and after selling my iMac briefly used a work PC at home as my primary computer for about three months.  That was enough for me, I needed another Mac for home - I just enjoy the experience much more.<br /><br />I initially had shopped for PC laptops with larger screens, and was a bit hesitant to get the 13"" screen, but it's worked out well for me - I use a DVI to HDMI cable to work at home on a 22"" widescreen monitor, and still have a laptop that is small enough to lug around when needed.<br /><br />I'm not thrilled with the initial specs on the MacBook, but a couple of them were easy to rectify - on the advice of another reviewer here, I immediately upgraded to 4GB of RAM on my own, and replaced the drive with a 360 GB 7200 RPM Seagate drive.

I have never been impressed with Macbooks before now, my wife has owned and used several generations of Intel based macbooks and I just couldn't see the appeal (until now).<br /><br />I cannot believe the battery life of this laptop, I cannot stress this enough, it is incredible! I have used this thing for hours every day since I received it, I charge once every 2-3 days... DAYS. My previous gaming laptop's intel i7-6700HQ would burn through its battery in 2 hours doing nothing. This thing can be on Teams, discord, Youtube, and paired with headphones through a whole workday without using a third of the battery.<br /><br />Already have a gaming PC? Moonlight (or Steamlink if you don't have an Nvidia card) allows you to stream games to your macbook, and provided you have a decent wifi6 (or better) router you'll get low latency gameplay for hours as the PC is doing all the real work! I have tested a few indie titles on the macbook itself and it performed admirably, but this isn't going to replace a console or desktop GPU for that purpose.<br /><br />I have larger than average hands and the keyboard is comfortable to type with. For any windows users not familiar with Mac OS, Command+Q to close things and Command+space to open the finder (like hitting the windows key) was all I needed to feel right at home with it! The touch bar at the top feels like a novelty more than a gamechanger but I may not be using its best functions.<br /><br />It produces very little heat even under a workload, the screen is bright and beautiful with a deep contrast and amazing colors. The build quality is solid as always. I would love to have at least 1 USB A port... but I understand that comes with the territory of Macbooks, luckily already had several OTG cables around to make up for it.<br /><br />If it wasn't obvious, I'm very happy with this laptop and strongly recommend it to anyone looking for something portable and functional that won't have you constantly looking for a power outlet!",0.78,,0.2510380371660859,,Macbook
"I just bought one locally from a university surplus store. It's  the 17 inch 2.6 ghz version with the higher resolution 1920 x 1200 screen. It's a GREAT Mac. It was missing the memory and hard drive and has some minor cosmetic issues as you would expect but works like a charm. I bought a 120 gig SSD on Amazon and 4 gig of ram. With the SSD drive it is now blazingly fast. My plan was to refurbish it, (before I retired I was a computer tech and manager), but after using it I've decided to keep it and enjoy the Mac ecosystem for a while. BTW the everymac.com site points out that this laptop will accept 6 gig of memory with one 4 gig and 1 2 gig SIMM in the two available slots. They mentioned it was third party memory and not from Apple. I don't know if that makes a difference but third party is cheaper. I think I'll give it a try. If it works for me I'll add a comment. I'm giving it 5 stars because it makes me happy, works perfectly after nearly 7 years of college lab use and has all the bells and whistles I need and then some.

"My sister-in-law recently purchased a new MacBook Air to replace her aging MacBook Pro.<br />Being that Apple has eliminated all but two USB C Thunderbolt 3 ports, she had no way to connect any of her ‚Äúvintage‚Äú USB 2 peripherals. Since she is what one may call ‚Äúcomputer challenged‚Äù, my wife volunteered my services to integrate her old equipment with her new Mac, so as to get her up and running.<br />Enter the XSPUS 8-in-1 USB C Hub. Currently, my Sister-in-Law has only one USB printer to connect, but the versatility (see specs) of this dock makes it future proof for any anticipated connections that she would need.<br />This hub is plug ‚Äôn‚Äô play on the MacBook - all that was needed was to plug the hub into the one of only two USB C Thunderbolt ports, then plug the printer into one of the USB ports on the hub, leaving six remaining ports (3 USB 3 ports, a 4K HDMI port, memory card  port, and a USB C charging port‚Ä¶ Ta-da, golden!<br />The footprint of the hub is quite slender, and the design robust, streamlined, and aesthetically pleasing; some may even say: ‚Äúsexy‚Äù, sporting a curved brushed aluminum chassis.

"Review update from the original post<br /><br />As far as cases go, I was going to initially try out the Apple SmartCase, but for $80, I thought I should at least check out what else was available.  I found this case that was similar in design but a bit more stylish and a lot cheaper.  Actually I was a little worried about it being so cheap on Amazon, but the reviews were good so I figured I'd give it a shot.  Turns out I had nothing to worry about.  Case seems to function just as well as Apples and it actually seems a bit sturdier.  It's made from synthetic materials instead of leather like the Apple case, but I like it even better.  Seems like it would be easier to clean (especially handy for when my kids get their hands on it) and just feels easier to grip for me.  At least that's my opinion.  You should check it out.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/iPad-Air-Case-Landscape-Generation/dp/B00OKUBFNC/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1415224806&sr=1-1&keywords=roocase+optigon+air+2<br /><br />Though it's only been a week since my initial review, I've been taking the iPad Air 2 to test out its capabilities further, much to the dismay of my family.  But as I mentioned earlier, I do have a windows tablet (8"" version) that I had been using as a supplement to my work computer.  I sometimes need to view spreadsheets, powerpoints or word docs away from the office and if it's just to check something or make a minor edit, it can be a major pain to pull out my full, work issued laptop.  I thought having full windows in a portable, as-needed, format was convenient.  But since I've been reading that the iPad is more productivity oriented in its present form, I had to see how it compared.  Especially since, I would have the convenience of the other tablet strengths of the iPad to boot.<br /><br />So far I'm impressed.  I've been using MS Office for iPad and I have to say that in many ways, it's even better than Office is on a small windows tablet.  I think the iPad version is more suited to a touch screen whereas the windows version still feels like they expect you to use a mouse.  I think the key is having the right Bluetooth keyboard and a good stand case for the iPad Air 2, especially when it comes to editing a complicated formula in an excel file.<br /><br />For the time being, I've been using a no-name, compact keyboard I had originally bought for the old iPad 2.  It came built into a case but of course that case doesn't fit the new iPad.  But luckily, the keyboard portion was removable.  I never liked having the keyboard attached when I wasn't using it anyway.  I will continue to try to find a better one as this one just feels a little too mushy for me.<br /><br />So far the iPad Air 2 is exceeding my expectations.  I just figured the old iPad we had was getting too old and needed replacing.  But, I'm quickly discovering that all the incremental improvements made between each generation has added up to a device that is pushing new ground for what a tablet is meant to be.  Like I mentioned in my review, I've tried a lot of different tablets, including Asus Transformer Pad with keyboards.  Even my older iPad didn't cut it as a productivity device.  But this new iPad is just faster and smoother making trying to get a little work done a lot less frustrating without giving up on anything that has made the iPad so convenient.<br /><br />-------------<br /><br />Original Post<br /><br />I've tried many different tablets including iPads, various Android tablets from older 10.1"" Honeycomb versions to the most recent Nexus 7 and even a Windows 8.1 tablet.  I originally started with the iPad 2 and it was the device that convinced me that tablets were worth the investment and served a useful purpose.  From there I tried several Android tablets.  It actually took that platform quite a while to catch up to the benchmark the iPad had set.  I started with a honeycomb tablet that required a lot of patience as bugs were worked out.  I ended up having to root it and try some custom roms to get the tablet to work the way I expected it to and even then it wasn't uncommon for the device to crash on me.  But eventually, Google was able to improve the OS and by the time the second generation Nexus 7 came out, they had finally achieved a truly usable device.<br /><br />As for Windows tablets, I don't really see them as an iPad competitor.  They are more like a miniature version of your PC you can take along with you in place of a full size laptop.  Sure the Metro interface does make it more tablet-like, but the lack of apps and reliance on the desktop screen keeps it from being that ""even a child can figure it out,"" used by everybody in that family, zero learning curve device.<br /><br />So while I've gone back and forth with devices, being the gadget geek that I am, my family and I have always had an iPad around when we wanted to quickly play a game, use an app or watch a video.  So when the new iPad Air 2 came out, I decided it was time bring home a new iPad.<br /><br />The thing I love most about the iPad is that it is so simple to use and no matter what you want to do, there is probably an app for it.  As fine a job Android has done playing catch up, there has never been an app that I wanted that I couldn't find in the App Store.  This used to be especially true for apps that gave you access to accounts you might have with a broker, an institution or a company.  It's not too much of an issue anymore since most companies now release both IOS and Android apps simultaneously.  I've even seen a few Android apps come out before the IOS version, but this wasn't always the case.  I think there are still a few companies that will still put more effort into their IOS release than they do Android.<br /><br />Holding the new iPad Air 2 in my hand I can see that Apple still sets the standard for the category of device they invented.  You might even say that the interface hasn't changed much from the original device they launched in 2010.  Sure there have been a lot of incremental improvements like the pull down notifications, additional gestures, and the ability to create folders to clean up the pages.  But, there was never a need for Apple to have a Project Butter initiative to improve the smoothness of how the device functioned because Apple had gotten it right from the start.  Each incremental improvement Apple has introduced has merely brought a very good system closer to perfection.<br /><br />I think they even got the screen size right.  Though the first iPad was a bit weighty, the 9.7"" screen size has always been perfect. While Android and other have set 10.1"" with a wide screen ratio as their standard and dabbled with even larger screen sizes, I have always found the 9.7"" 4:3 ratio to be the perfect portable size for a tablet.  Even when you compare a 10.1"" Android tablet next to the iPad, though there isn't much of a difference in screen size, the iPad seems much more portable while still giving the illusion that the screen is just as big if not bigger.  Now that they have reduce the size of the bezel further and increased the resolution, the current screen is absolutely stunning.  Going in the other direction, while I've never owned the iPad Mini myself, the 7.9"" screen with the 4:3 ratio to me just seems to be a lot easier to read from than the smaller 7"" screens with a 16:9 ratio that have become the standard for smaller Android tablets.<br /><br />As for the weight and thinness of the current iPad, it is just unbelievable.  Comparing the new iPad to some of the older devices I have lying around is like comparing a Macbook Air or Ultrabook to the old HP laptops I use to have to carry around.  Honestly, picking up my backpack, I have to double check that I packed my iPad because there is no way I can tell by the weight whether it's in there or not.<br /><br />The interface is so much smoother now with the faster chip.  There is never even a hint of lag and pages load instantaneously.<br />As the iPads wider ecosystem has evolved, it has even become capable of some limited productivity.  Add a Bluetooth keyboard and attach a nice stand case and you can actually do some work.  Microsoft Office Apps and iMovie have given it the ability to create documents, spreadsheets and videos.<br /><br />Not that the iPad is perfect.  The device seems to vibrate when you put it on maximum volume.  It's still not as customizable as the Android interface.  But it's still the closest I've seen so far to the perfect tablet experience.",0.9199999999999999,,0.196120833461259,,Macbook

"To start off I want to say I am glad I bought this iMac. I did not buy mine off here (Amazon) I bought mine off craigslist for about $150.00. The one I have is the 20 inch with 128 Mb graphics card. My iMac did come with snow leopard preinstalled but I upgraded to Lion (10.7). I also upgraded the ram from 1GB up to 3GB and the hard drive to a 256 GB SSD that I had laying around. After I made those upgrades this thing just flies. This iMac may have nothing against my 2015 MacBook air but its much faster then it use to be. I am very surprised to be honest that this computer performs as well as it does because this thing was made in 2006 and now its 2015 going on 2016 in about 2 months. That means this iMac is almost 10 years old!! I am only 20 years old. I work on computers, read up on computers, and really understand them. 10 years for a computer is like 70 years in human years its just crazy to me that this iMac is still able to go on youtube and watch videos, play some games and do just about anything I need it to do. I wish I was older when Steve Jobs introduced these white iMacs because they are my favorite generation. I like the build quality, the matte screen, and just the overall construction. The iMac connects to my wireless mouse and keyboard just fine through bluetooth and connects to my wifi with the built in wifi card. If I had to say the one thing I really don't like about these white iMacs I would have to say I don't like how they can't update past Lion. It seems like these iMacs have decent graphics cards, has just enough memory to handle the update and has a pretty good processor. I am not sure if Apple didn't let these update because they wanted people to upgrade or if its for a different reason either way it sucks. I think if you are new to the Mac ecosystem and your not sure if you want to spend $1000.00 on a Mac that this Mac would be a great start. If you can find one of these 20 inch iMacs for about $200.00 maybe even $250.00 I think its a good buy because you get a handful of features that the newer iMacs get (Not all the new feature but most of them) you also get to see what its like using the Mac OS along with the keyboard and mouse. I know at first I was not use to the 1 click button because I had been using Windows my whole life. You also get a pretty decent computer that does just about anything if you keep your expectations low. All in all this is a fantastic computer to learn with if you want to start buying Macs or if your like me someone likes to collect older computers.

"My white Macbook's screen started to work funky after my cat sat on the laptop while it was closed. It would only work if I held it and put a bit of pressure with my finger. I bought a replacement screen off Ebay a year ago and within a few months, it started developing spots on the screen every time I opened the laptop. I don't know why this happened, because I was keeping it out of my cat's reach and I wasn't putting any pressure or weight on the laptop while it was closed. My guess is that it was just a cheap, bad quality screen. When I installed the first screen, I felt very frustrated. The connector is tiny, at a weird angle, and very fragile. It took me over an hour. I ordered this screen, which was double the price of my first one. I'm hoping it is a much better quality. I've had no issues so far. I also think it is quite bright, contrary to what others are saying. This time, it literally took me under 5 minutes to install the screen. I obviously recommend watching a video first, but what I most importantly recommend is using a spudger. I had gotten one recently from a phone battery I purchased. My spudger is a bit curved at the end and a thin tip. I put the laptop with the screen flat on the desk and pushed the cable into the connector with the spudger easily. The first time I had nothing else but metal tweezers which can damage the connector/cable. This screen comes with two protective screens: the obvious one and the not so obvious one. That's why a lot of people in the reviews are complaining about the red apple shape around the bottom left hand corner. That is a peel off protector!",0.8400000000000001,,0.03661111111111112,,Macbook

"I recently bought the updated 2016 Space Grey 12 inch Macbook. I opted for the 256 gig with the upgraded m7 1.3ghz processor because I'll never really need the 512GB in the other version. The better CPU helps me out all the time, however, and since I travel a lot this is pretty helpful for me. I use a 2015 13 inch Macbook Pro at the office, i5 dual core version, and this little macbook 12 to me feels pretty close in performance. I think the 64 bit Geekbench multicore score of both the 12 inch and the Macbook Pro were in the 6700 range (compared to around 4400ish on the base 2015 macbook 12 model). Of course the macbook 12 will throttle down much quicker. The single port doesn't bother me - I'm rarely plugging anything in. Thunderbolt 3 would have been nice for 4k X 60Hz on a display, but most of the time I use this on the go.<br /><br />One of my friends has the Skylake Dell XPS 13. That's also a nice laptop but I find myself spoiled by how quiet and cool the macbook runs. The XPS will heat up, fans blazing, even when just browsing the web sometimes. It's more powerful but it just depends on your use case. I really like the quiet design.<br /><br />Overall good computer, and a little on the expensive side. I'd get the 1.3 ghz m7 model as the speed difference is quite noticeable.",0.86,,0.12292063492063492,,Macbook
"I laughed recently when I was told about an outlaw (an in-law's in-law) who read my wife the riot act because we use Apple products. It took me back to the time a number of years ago that I did the same to people who chose Macs over PCs. That was in the days before iPhones and iPads, even before iPods. At the time, it seemed that everybody except a few college students was using machines that ran on windows.  I remember bragging about how great my laptop was and what I could do with it.<br /><br />Fast forward to today, when we use an iMac at home, iPads for a variety of tasks and I carry an iPhone. I have gone through a succession of MacBooks, from a basic MB to a MB Pro that I loved. I had reached the place, however, that I just carried my iPad with me in a nice Zagg case with keyboard. I wasn't sure I would ever carry a laptop again.<br /><br />My travel got bumped up a bit this year and I found some weakness with my iPad.  I'm a touch typist who found that the loss of my bluetooth keyboard or airplanes was more than a small disruption.  I was also missing some robust software that just couldn't be matched by the company's IOS app.  Therefore, I decided to try out the 11.6-Inch MB Air.  Here is what surprised me:<br /><br />1. This Air is so small and light that I have no problem carrying it and my iPad with a smart cover.  The weight gain from this little computer is negligible.<br />2.  My former MB Pro had 8 GB of memory and I was concerned that this one only had 4GB. The updated processor and the SSD drive make the new computer significantly faster.<br />3.  The keyboard is full-size and helps me stay focused on the screen, where my work is taking place.<br />4. The display itself, though small, is just enough workspace for the word-crunching that I do.<br /><br />For those who are considering a migration from windows, imagine life without the &#34;blue screen of death.&#34;  Think about the ease of document management between your laptop and those other i-devices you probably already have.

Locking back in after a simple screen lock (not a log out) when it was idle for hours took inordinately long to do.

"Hey Everyone,<br />I finally ordered my Mid 2011 Mac Mini from Amazon :)<br />I also bought all the accessories over the last few months, like Apple Wireless Keyboard, Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, HDMI cable and of course the Macbook Air External Superdrive :)<br />I also bought the LG 23 inch LED 1080p Monitor, so finally I got the last ingredient of this Magic Computing.<br />I also installed the Corsair 8GB of DDR3 RAM, and all I can say, is that I never knew what Apple was really about until today.<br />I have my iPhone 4 and iPad 2, but this computer is so smooth and fast, that my 4 year old Dell XPS desktop has been packed up and is sitting in my closet lol<br />This Mac Mini is the best little computer I have ever used, and I am in love with Apple all over again :)<br />If you want a Mac on a budget, don't hesitate one bit, but buy this Mac Mini, you won't be disappointed, I guarantee you :)<br />Also if you think that the Intel HD 3000 graphics of this computer is not good enough, then you better think again, because the graphics are super clear and crisp. Awesome color, and pictures plus video editing looks spectacular. Don't forget to upgrade the RAM to 8GB though, because with the 2GB the computer was sure sluggish lol. I actually can barely wait until I get the Apple 27 inch Display for this Mac Mini, and then via Thunderbolt it will be heaven thats for sure.<br />I also noticed that my audio has changed and is so much better then on the Dell XPS. Apple is sure the best every way you look at it :)<br /><br />I cannot say anything bad about this little monster, but upgrade the RAM to 8GB, its so worth it :)<br />I honestly don't think that the $799 Mac Mini is worth the extra $200 for a slightly faster CPU and a dedicated ATI GPU. This Intel HD 3000 has really surprised me, because I remember all those old integrated graphics from the 90's and 2000's, so this puppy is superb!!!!!<br /><br />Don't wait and get this Mac Mini, and you will be in heaven just like I am right now as I am writing this review :)<br />Go Buy One Now!!!

"With so many reviews posted, I am sure that all the major pro and cons have been covered, perhaps even over covered! So, let me just speak to my best personal observations and leave all the tech speak to others.<br /><br />I've been a life long Apple / Mac user. The first computer I ever touched was an Apple / Mac, but I can't tell you the model number. All I remember is that large, rainbow colored Apple logo! LOL Anyway, I always preferred Macs to PC's--even though I was often required to use PC's at work. At home, the computer was alway Mac!<br /><br />Just recently, I was shopping for a new laptop; I wanted a small, flexible, but powerful system that was easy to take and easy to use. I was actually tempted--the shame of it--by a good deal on a fine looking Sony Vaio. I compared it to the MacBook and MacBook Pro. I mulled over the decision for a week, and I had the opportunity to look at a new laptop with Vista, the flowered-faced monster operating system that everyone at work seems to be complaining about as everyone receives their upgrades in turn. To make a long story short, good ""Mac"" sense finally kicked in, and I eliminated the Viao from my potential purchase list. [I might have to work with Vista at the office, but I don't have to live with it, even if it comes in a pretty package! LOL] I then had to decide between the MacBook and MacBook Pro. AND at the end of the day, the deal breaker came down to choice: MacBook gave a choice between Black and White. [The MacBook Pro looks rather silver.] Well, I've had beige Macs and white Macs and Graphite colored Macs. I never had a Black one. So, the black one with its generous keyboard and large trackpad appealed to me.<br /><br />With hand on my heart, I can say that this is the best Mac I've ever had the opportunity to operate; it is the best Mac that I have ever personally owned. The software that I chose to get for this new computer was IWork 08 because I read good things about it--if you don't want or need all of Microsoft Office's bulk and sulk. I also purchased Internet Security Barrier Back-up Edition and StoryMill. Oh --if you love Widgets, you can download extra ones from Apple's official website.<br /><br />As with any big purchase, though, do research before you make decisions. Decide what you want the computer for and how you will mostly use it. The best computer for you is the one that you will use with contentment and productivity.",0.82,,0.2715000040994359,,Macbook

"I really do like this product, the design is very nice.  I do however had some gripes with it that make me give it a 3.5 rating (If I could).<br /><br />The Good:  Very well designed.  Runs cool even at high processor usage.  OS X starts up very fast.<br /><br />The Bad:  While Windows Vista does install as advertised I find the mouse driver provided to be a headache when attempting to right click as it confuses it with two finger scrolling even though i'm not moving my fingers up and down the pad.  The Apple forums have several complaints on this issue to no resolution or updated drivers.<br /><br />OS X also has its share of problems such as Safari that loves to freeze or crash, especially on certain sites like CNN.com.  In addition I had to rename my entire network to workgroup for me to connect to my Windows shared printer, as changing the workgroup settings on OS X did nothing.<br /><br />Also I sometimes have issues with shutting down OS X, especially if Safari or another app is crashing.  It does not seem to want to do a force everything to shut down like Linux or Windows is capable of.<br /><br />Another note is that the product can scratch very easily (as I see with the power adaptor) and thats why I have used an InCase case from day one.<br /><br />Additional of odd note is that sounds is much louder (at the highest setting) in Windows than on OS X.<br /><br />The end note is that using Windows is required for me and advertised as working as such and while only 98% of what I want works, the right clicking on lists that love to scroll is a headache.  Additionally I don't find that OS X works 100% and has it issues as well especially with Safari.  I find myself using Opera.",0.82,,0.14307692307692313,,Macbook

"I just recently switched from a HP laptop to a white macbook. I have never liked Macs before because I thought they were ""techy"", complicated, and everything seemed backward. It did take me about a week to get used to it but I would never go back now. After listening to the Apple guy at best buy's lecture on how great these computers were I never looked back. Sure, they may be more expensive but it's well worth it. The fact that I won't have to worry about the dreaded viruses and spyware hacking my bank account and credit cards was enough for me, but the features of this book far surpass anything a PC has. These boot up so fast in half (or less) the time that it took for my hp. There are a few (small) issues I have with this laptop though. The outside of the book got pretty scratched just after a week or so of not having a cover on it, but I did buy one through apple's website and that took care of that. I missed my right click mouse button so I bought a wireless one for under $30. iWork 09 doesn't come with it and it's a $100 extra dollars. I feel like they should include this program instead of ones not all of us will use like iMovie and Garageband. It has the equivilant of Microsoft office- Powerpoint (keynote) Word (Pages) and Excel (Numbers) with so many more features and templates than the Microsoft version.

"This is not a laptop for writers. Unless you type less than 50 wpm. The butterfly mechanisms in the keyboard-- as of yet a new type of mechanism which made its debut in the first 12 inch macbook but which hasn't been improved upon-- are of such a design that the keys only register input if you hit them directly. The space bar is only sensitive on about 60% of it & many other keys, of which the 'k' is the most common for me. I opened a case with Apple after having this for 6 weeks & they footed the bill to have it inspected. The service claimed it was dirty inside, but they had seen a lot of these newer macbooks for the same issue.

"A good indication of addiction would be if I am so afraid of product discontinuation that I buy an identical one while available even if my current one is running well. I am almost tempted to do it. This one is destined to be a classic, in my opinion. Like many, I have used all sorts of laptops in the past and this is the only one that does not feel like a laptop -- maybe because of the solid, smooth and sturdy plastic construction, maybe because of the clean white look, maybe because of the wonderful keyboard touch. Just about everything about this product exudes quality. It is so easy to underestimate this laptop because of its simple, benign look, but it runs programs actually faster than all my desktops. No squeaking anywhere after a full year of use and abuse. Quality parts in and out. The magnetic power adapter is a thing of beauty -- without it, I would have destroyed the adapter outlet whenever I dropped it from my bed where I happen to use my laptop extensively.<br /><br />I mostly use Windows Vista with this laptop, using the supplied bootcamp software. I see absolutely no degradation in speed or performance. No extra crashes either. When using Vista, the experience is just like any other Windows-running computers I have. This should be a big relief for Windows Vista users. So if you are hesitating purchasing this one just because you do not intend to use Windows, let me tell you this clearly: This thing beats almost all Windows-running computers on the Windows-turf.<br /><br />If I make just one suggestion to Apple, it is that the outermost edges of the plastic cover on the keyboard side fall apart over time and perhaps this needs to be addressed. It does not affect the performance but I am concerned dusts may get inside the laptop, apart from aesthetic reasons. But since this product is so wonderful, I am willing to even let go of this issue. It is that good.<br /><br />One suggestion to purchasers: To make this product even better, buy a 2G memory and a 250G internal hard disk from any internet vendor. They are so cheap these days. Just make sure you get the correct ones for this model; vendors will be most happy to assist you with that. It is a breeze to install them yourself (there are many sites on the Internet that show you how to do it step by step -- it takes 5 minutes to install both the extra memory and the hard disk, although it takes much much longer to reinstall all your programs). Never buy higher spec model from Apple as you will grossly overpay for the bigger memory and bigger hard disk.

"I consider this a good, if not ideal, laptop which I bought for my student-daughter who thought it was a Mac Air.  It's small, but powerful & Apple combines software that seems great for it, but you have to buy work utilities.

The unbreakable magnetic cord reminds me of my old Compac Presario laptop falling with the plug in & put out of commission by a broken jack.  The white finish is easy to clean, strong, & won't dent or conduct heat - it does grab her mascara flakes, but they come of with cleaning wipes & this is supposed to be hers anyhow.  This is the 2.4Ghz, 2GB unit that some later ones don't even have (economics, I guess; they're 2.0 & 2.1 Ghz).  I think it's much handier than the larger versions.

"Bought this laptop for my wife. She switched from Windows 8.1 to Mavericks. There was a bit of a learning curve, which is to be expected, but she took right to her Mac. I'm not a huge fan of the &#34;everything proprietary&#34; approach: it makes the Mac hard to compare to anything else - but she loves it and Apple's pre-installed suite of software (which now includes Works). She also loves the fact that her iPhone and her Mac sync automatically via iCloud.<br />Two possible improvements:<br />a) on our home-brewed battery rundown test, the Macbook 11-inch ran out of juice 5.3 hours into running an .mkv video on a loop, using the VLC Media player. I'm told Quicktime might do better, but Quicktime is not a great player.  This much less than the advertised battery life. In normal browsing and word-processing, the battery life increases to nearly 9 hours. But many of us watch videos on those cross-country flights and 5.3 hours is cutting it close.<br />b) How about a touch screen? That would make it even more like an iPhone.",0.6799999999999999,,0.021336996336996338,,Macbook

"I did my research prior to replacing my 13&#34; MacBook Pro.  I had it for less than two years and barely used it because I had the same exact laptop for work.  I figured I'd offload my personal MBP since it was in mint condition and get something a bit more suitable for my uses.  I don't cut video, I don't record music, I'm not editing photos.  The MBP was too much machine for me and it was going to waste.  I surf the web, watch Netflix, check email, and - of course - shop on Amazon.  I was also seeking more portability; I wanted something I could carry in my backpack every single day and not even know it was there.  Since I'd be carrying it day in and day out, I wanted a laptop with a battery that would last.  I found all of those things in the 12&#34; MacBook.<br /><br />It's a laptop that's ACTUALLY the size of a notebook.  It's speedy, well-designed, and appealing to the eye.  I see a lot of folks commenting on the new keyboard but I've had no issues with it.  With a new design will obviously come a learning curve.  I've been typing on it all day and, to be completely honest, I can't tell the difference from my MBP.  I also see comments about it's speed.  To those people I ask this: what are you using this thing for?  You can't buy this laptop and expect it to be a video editing powerhouse.  That has NEVER been the job of a baseline MacBook, so why would you expect that to change?  Apple invented the Pro series MacBooks for all of you that were seeking something with more horsepower to edit video, photos, etc.  Stick with that.  Finally, I have to comment on the speakers.  This thing sounds REALLY good for it's size and also in comparison to my 13&#34; MBP.  I kinda can't believe it.  As a musician, I'm impressed with the audio it pumps out.<br /><br />I don't want to hear from the folks who say you can get a PC for much less money and do the same things.  I know you can.  But does it look as good?  Does it operate as flawlessly?  Will it last as long?  Will it work seamlessly with my iPhone?  No, no, no, and no.  Been there, done that.  All in all, this is a well-designed piece of technology.  I absolutely love it and would recommend it to anyone seeking something portable for light duty work.  If you know what you're buying, this laptop is a homerun.",0.86,,0.23962391774891775,,Macbook

"I bought a Titanium laptop - at full price several years ago when they were the new hot thing. It has never been much more than a door stop.

I brought it to the ""genius"" bar, on the north shore of Massachusetts, for help.

"I have been using Windows machines for about the last 20 years.  For a change, I decided to try the Mac in late 2009 for a home machine, as I wasn't impressed with any of the PC/Win Vista laptop offerings at the time.  I use the Mac just about every day as a home computer for mail, surfing, photo organization, etc.  I also continue to work on a Windows machine at work - meaning I have to switch between the two daily.  A few main points I would like to share:<br /><br />1) Need to run Windows with BootCamp, Parallels, or VMWare - I purchased VMWare thinking I would need it, but haven't even installed it yet.  Most everything I need comes with the Mac, or is available on the Internet for free.  In fact, I have not purchased any software for the Mac, other than a word processor / spreadsheet application.  All file formats I use and/or create (PDF, DOC, XLS, JPG) can be passed between my Windows work machine and Mac w/o issues.<br /><br />2) The small form factor of this laptop, within the aluminum case make this a joy to fold up and carry around.  With any of the Windows laptop I have used, when you unfold the machine and start to use it again (waking from standby), you are not sure if the machine will wake up correctly, be connected to the Internet, etc.  The Mac works flawlessly in this respect, in that you open it and its ready to go in a few seconds.<br /><br />3) The screen / video is great.  I am sure you can get the same screens and video hardware in Windows based laptops, but you will have to pay a bit more.  Thus, for the hardware you get, you don't a lot more for the Mac than Windows PC (at least for the 13"" model)<br /><br />4) The machine is quiet, and you never hear the fan running.  I laugh as I write this as my wife's Toshiba fan is kicking in, making this terrible whirling noise.<br /><br />5) The touch pad is large, about twice the size of a typical Windows laptop.  This large size makes the OSX 'gestures' usable, for scrolling pages windows, moving back and forward, etc.  Once you get familiar with the gestures, its makes the laptop experience a lot better.  I find myself not needing the external mouse, and never use one.  One problem though, when I move to my Windows laptop, and by habit do the same gestures, w/o luck ;)<br /><br />6) OSX versus Windows - I think both are great OS's.  I will say though that the Mac/OSX environment is much more controlled, and this is where the advantage comes in for stability and performance.  Think about the fact that Windows must support 1000's of different hardware types, including device drivers for all of these.  The chances of instability, conflicts, etc. is quite high.  With the Mac, the hardware is very limited and specific, allowing developers to focus and test much better, with the results being a more stable platform.<br /><br />7) Applications - Windows has many more choices of applications.  However the limited number of applications available for the Mac is also sometimes a blessing as they are integrated better, and play nicely to together.  Take for example iPhoto integrated with iMovie, etc.  This become even more important if you have an iPhone, as you want to have a smaller set of 'good' applications playing nicely together.<br /><br />8) Mac Keyboard shortcuts - if you don't use a mouse, keyboard shortcuts make things happen much more quicker.  Mac has a lot of support for keyboard shortcuts, and you can do just about anything with a keyboard shortcut.  This makes the usability and experience much better, you just need to learn the shortcuts.<br /><br />9) Reliability - I have read some reviews both on Amazon and professional.  A computer is a computer, and if you abuse it, it will break.  Hard drives are hard drives, used both in Windows and Mac PCs.  Eventually they do fail, and the harder you are on your laptop (moving, shaking, bumping), the quicker they will fail.  The same goes for other components, great care is required to get maximum life.<br /><br />10) Support - While never needing support from Mac, I have read that its probably the best in the industry.  Combine that will the Apple Store, where you can walk in, and talk to a real person who understands English.  For anyone who is not that familiar with working with computers, this is a huge advantage.<br /><br />In summary, for the standard computer user who is not an IT wizard, the Mac Book makes a lot of sense.  Yes, the price of a Mac is higher, but if you combine the better stability along with the better support from Apple, its money well spent.",0.8,,0.21387936507936506,,Macbook

"I am an IT product manager for a large nationwide AV technology company. I specify and recommend IT products to our many locations. I will no longer recommend Apple products based on my own personal experience. This laptop has given me nothing but issues over the 1+ year I owned it. I won't go over the minute details, but basically it was in for repairs at least 5-6 times to replace the battery, hard drive, random reboot, discoloration on the plastic, SuperDrive, etc.<br /><br />The last issue I had was just this week. The screen began to flicker constantly and I was about to take it to my local Apple store when my wife accidently spilled water on the keyboard. As I said before, the logic board (motherboard) was already defective before the spillage. Because of the water damage, even though I have AppleCare, the repair is not covered--Apple wants close to $1000 for parts/labor to repair a system that at this point, it's not even worth that anymore. I can't believe the Mac ""genius"" even suggested repairing it when a new unit costs that much.<br /><br />I have always been a big Apple fan for many years and have owned many of their products. I have bought and recommended Power Macs G4/G5, MacBooks/Pro, iMacs, CinemaDisplays, MacPros, you name it! Many of our locations complain about the premium price that our company pays for an Apple product as opposed to a Dell system.

"This is my first mobile Mac -  and I like it.  I had spent more than a few hours pondering the decision of which MacBook to get and I feel that I picked the right one for my needs.<br /><br />This White 2.0 MacBook is a terrific combination of price and features:  you can expect similar performance to the uni-body Aluminum 2.0 MacBooks, but $100s cheaper.  Plus, this MacBook comes with FireWire and uses cheaper DDR2 ram.  Only significant trade off that I can see is losing the uber-cool uni-body design.  Less significant is not getting the uni-Body's  LED backlight, multi-touch, and some monitor support.<br /><br />Comparing this MacBook to previous generation MacBooks (non-unibody); the change to the NVIDIA GeForce 9400M will provide a large boost in graphics performance over the Intel units.  Supposedly, this is new hardware that OS X 10.6 will be able to take further advantage of.<br /><br />Overall performance has surprised me.  I had planned to drop in 4GB of ram and a 7200 rpm hard drive, but I am so pleased with the operation that I  just don't see the need.  I use it for web browsing, iPhoto, Mail, Word, Excel, etc.  So far I have not experienced any stutters or pauses.  If I were to run Vista apps or edit HD video, I am sure that this might change the need for more ram.<br /><br />Regarding comfort, I have not noted any heat build-up, nor is there excessive fan noise.  Keep in mind that I haven't taxed it much.  The overall build quality seems fine.<br /><br />Through the years I usually bought from Apple's refurb store, but I am am very pleased with this purchase and feel that I received an excellent value.<br /><br />Follow-up Feb 26, 2009:  ""Still 5 Stars""<br /><br />After several weeks of use on a daily basis, I continue to be impressed by this product and just how much OS X has advanced (and I am also a very heavy XP/Vista laptop user in my professional life).

"&#34;These MacBook notebooks are NEW in condition and come with a Woot warranty (not an Apple Warranty). This is why we can offer a discount. These were originally intended as warranty replacements, and held by Apple to support their customers. Now we offer them to you!&#34;<br /><br />This is a bit misleading - &#34;new-adjacent&#34; might be more accurate.  The smudge marks and dust in the speaker grill are give-aways.  It's in decent condition, but NEW in all caps would not be a proper descriptor of the Macbook I was sent by Woot!.<br /><br />Laptop arrived complete drained in a white label box, marked with AS-IS designation - will update review once it gets enough charge to turn on and get setup.<br /><br />*** UPDATE ***<br /><br />So far everything has worked well with the Macbook.

That said, the battery cycle count was &#60; 10, so if it was used, it wasn't much or for long.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with the laptop and the transaction.

"I have always been a heavy Windows user dating all the way back to the release of version 3.1 (approx 16 years ago).  I was never interested in the Mac do to what I perceived as the proprietary nature of their systems and what I thought was an expensive price tag. Here is what I discovered when I purchased this model of Mac:<br /><br />1.  It just works.  The boot up time is less than half of what it takes my Windows laptop, and the shut down time (4 seconds) is only a fraction of the  30-40 seconds of my Toshiba.<br />2.  It runs Windows Vista faster than my Toshiba.  I still need to run a couple of Windows applications, so I went through the VERY easy bootcamp installation of Vista.  It runs flawlessly and after having purchased Fusion for $79, I am now able to run Windows apps alongside Mac apps.  Simply incredible.<br />3.  Battery life is great.  I can get 4 hours out of mine running in low power mode.<br />4.  Why no card reader????  Almost all PCs now come with card readers to use with your digital camera.  Why does Mac not include this???  :(<br />5.  It does NOT require the regular restarts that my Windows systems have always required.  Simply close the lid and put it to sleep at night, and the next morning lift the lid and you are back in business.  I can do this with my Toshiba but start getting errors in Windows after a couple of days and need to reset.  Also, my Macbook runs very cool (with little heat) in the sleep mode, thereby allowing  me to put it in my brief case in sleep mode without it heating up.  I could never do that with any of my PC laptops.  They would always heat up.<br />6.  No virus software needed.  Happy, Happy, Happy.  Surfing the internet is faster because of this.  Also, opening a document in MS Word is faster because the Virus software is not screening it.<br />I purchased MS Office and loaded it.  It runs great and is almost identical to its Windows counterpart in functionality.  But, Word and Excel seem to boot up a bit slower than the Windows versions.  This is one thing that I do not like.<br />7.  I like the way the electric cord connects with a magnet instead of plugging in.  This seems handier and better in design, but I wonder if the magnet will still be as strong two years from now?<br /><br />All in all, I am extremely pleased with this Mac.  When you compare the price with the included features, it is only slightly more expensive than a comparable PC.  To me it is worth the extra $200.<br /><br />Actually what is going to make this very expensive, is now that my wife and daughter have seen my Mac they are both wanting to replace their PCs as well.  This is one expense I did NOT budget for.<br /><br />Thanks for reading.  Hope this helps",0.82,,0.14861882716049382,,Macbook

"I've wanted an Apple laptop for quite sometime and now that I'm consulting on my own finally got to choose my computer (good) and pay for it myself (bad). Overall, I'm rather happy with the MacBook and OS X 10.5 is a vast improvement over Microsoft XP. The machine is fast even when running older apps (like MS Office 2004), its been reliable, and after a few setup headaches (I admit I was trying to do fancy stuff) I have no major complaints. Some things that need improvement or you need to factor in:<br />- expensive, obviously its a lot more than any standard PC laptop, make sure its worth the extra $$ to you<br />- every single mark shows on the outside of the case, I already have some light scratches and I've rarely left the house!<br />- the keyboard also gets dirty quickly, I highly recommend one of the ""skins"", I bought one a few weeks later<br />- Boot Camp is fine if you need to run Windows apps but its very inconvenient. If you justify the price by saying its a PC & Mac for one price, you should factor in the cost of virtual machine software (like Parallels or Fusion). If you do PC work regularly, the constant rebooting is a real PITA. I tried to get away with Boot Camp to save money but ended up buying VMware Fusion a few weeks later. That said, Windows runs great on this machine, probably better than most PC laptops but you need to get used to the keyboard layout<br />- if you're an advanced user and want to partition your HD into more than just a Mac & Boot Camp partition (i.e. 2 partitions), do some research first, I wasted days trying to figure this out<br />- if you're installing Windows XP, you might want to use the original CD to make a disc image, burn it to a blank disc, then install from the copy. For some reason many MacBooks won't read a genuine MS install CD, again days I wasted that you just saved<br />- if you really need to use MS Office, be aware of the compromises, especially in Excel, they've taken away some power user features from Mac Office 2008 that are available in the PC version. I'll probably end up buying the new version because I use Excel a lot and I'm just praying its better than Office 2004 which is awful<br />- same caution with other older software that you might have from the PPC days, its runs but seems really rough around the edges compared to native apps, you're probably going to want to buy new software<br />- you need to buy a separate video adapter to hook this up to a projector or LCD screen<br /><br />Overall a good but pricey laptop with some compromises depending on what you need to do with it.",0.76,,0.1383937268089054,,Macbook

"I did not get this from Amazon, but I must say I am highly impressed with this laptop. I use Macs for a more complete UNIX environment they provide in software writing compared to the pain in the tail Linux can be, and I plan to use this for schooling as well. For how weak the specs are compared to most standard laptops today, I was quite surprised at the responsiveness of it, even with software writing as well as having many other applications open. For a fanless setup on such a small logic board, it stays surprisingly cool (given that you don't expose it to a heavily warm environment). I can't get over how thin the laptop is.<br /><br />Mine came with Mac OS X El Capitan but I did upgrade it to macOS Sierra (the latest version of the OS), and the upgrade went flawlessly.<br /><br />The only gripes I have is it only having one USB-C port, which requires you to get an external adapter for more ports and to even have the standard USB-A port everyone uses still. MacBook Air has this beat on that. I also don't exactly agree with its price due to its low-end specs compared to the rest of the lineup, as it has the weakest overall hardware of all the Macs except the Mini. The only thing that saves it is the data transfer speeds on its storage, which makes up for a weak processor. Even though it has turbo boosting capability, the i5's are still better in raw data processing (not graphics).<br /><br />Also the MacBook Air has a rather quiet fan, so I don't see why it needed to be fanless IMO.",0.86,,0.12135278514588861,,Macbook
"The AppleCare Protection Plan is, as I believe someone else may have said, a necessary evil. As someone who has worked in IT in several different capacities (including working for Dell doing on-site & in-home warranty support/repair as well as my own small Tech Support / Security Consulting company) I recommend all of the warranty you can get. Especially for Macs, as although they historically don't break down as often as Windows systems, they can be very expensive to repair (though it's better than it used to be in the Motorola/PPC days since the advent of the ""Mactel"" architecture). One repair could easily cost more than the price of getting the extra protection. Even if you plan on replacing a part yourself, if it's anything proprietary or that has to come from Apple, the parts can be quite expensive.<br /><br />That being said, do yourself a favor and SHOP AROUND!!! You don't have to purchase AppleCare right away; just make sure to do it BEFORE the factory warranty expires. That gives you plenty of time to wait for a good price. I just bought mine: [[ASIN:B000JZ76IK AppleCare Protection Plan - For Portable Apple Computers 15 Inches and Above]] for HALF of the regular price of $350. That's the lowest price I've seen since I got my MacBook Pro & started watching the prices. Ironically, I was somewhat hesitant to buy it BECAUSE of the price. Kind of one of those ""Is this too good to be true?"" questions, especially since it was over $100 less than the sale prices of all of the other vendors, as well as the fact that it was a 3rd-party vendor named ""Coomsey"" that fulfilled AND shipped it. In addition, Coomsey had only 2 feedback reviews which were only a few weeks old, but at least they were both 5 out of 5! Turns out, it was a fantastic transaction. Not only was it new, authentic, factory sealed, with a working Serial #, instead of receiving it within the Delivery Estimate of November 24 - December 10, I received it on November 19; two days after I ordered it! I would tell everyone to go buy one from this company/person, but they are now apparently sold out. There are still plenty of other vendors selling them, but their average price is about $275-$280 for the 15"" & up Portable Plan. That seems to be about the normal ""sale"" price. I apparently got lucky finding the price I did.<br /><br />I never used to buy any kind of extended warranty, especially for computers since I could usually fix any problems myself. Then I had the 1st LCD TV I ever bought whack out just after the factory warranty expired (& this was back when a 27"" cost about $800 or so. Then my XBOX died, and finally a few months ago my HP laptop started going downhill fast about a month after the factory warranty expired. Since that time I've purchased another XBOX, a 42"" Sanyo LCD TV, an external HD, plus my MacBook Pro: all of which I bought extra warranty coverage for. Out of all of these, I'm most confident in the AppleCare plan.<br /><br />In addition, Apple adds those few little extras and actually makes it relatively easy to get your Apple product repaired or your question answered. I've dealt with many companies in the Tech field, both as a home user as well as representing large companies, and most of the time it seems as if they try and make it as difficult as possible for a customer to actually return a product or receive support. With Apple, you can walk into a local Apple Store, mail it off to them with pre-paid shipping, or even have them send you the part to replace yourself. Their Phone support is also very good. I also like the fact that it's not just strictly hardware; you can actually call them up if you have a question on covered Software. They also include TechTool Deluxe on the CD, which is a Diagnostic/Repair application that checks a number of different aspects of your Mac for problems and can also attempt to fix them.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you're going to invest the money to buy an Apple- do yourself a favor & go ahead and spend the extra cash on the Protection Plan. BUT - SHOP AROUND & WAIT FOR A GOOD PRICE!

"If you are fine using the device as just a hub with no intention of charging, this hub will work great. However, if you were hoping to use the 60W power delivery port to keep your laptop topped off good luck. My spouse's work 2020 Macbook Air (using a 30W USB-C charger) charges at 15W though this product: a full 1/4 the advertised amperage. The Intel CPU's TPD is 15 watts all on its own. If the CPU is running full throttle lets do the math: 15W (charging) - 15W (CPU) + 'X' W (all of the other components like screen, motherboard, RAM, etc) = a negative number. Negative power means I am drawing more power than I am receiving from the supposed '60W' capacity. I'll try with a replacement, but I am dubious it will fix an issue that has many such complaints.<br /><br />Most higher power computers will need much closer to the full 100 W of power delivery. That means even if it were working properly, 60W is not enough for many devices on the market. Check the power rating on your charger to make sure it is below 60W before even giving this thing a try. A hint: if the processor doesn't end with a 'U', it likely will need at least 60W to charge. And even if it is under 60W, don't hold your breath waiting for it to charge.

"Review from a PhD Student<br />--------<br />So, I thought a lot about which laptop to get and learned some things along the way. The following review is aimed at those who are in a similar position to me: I am a graduate student whose life revolves around the laptop but I'm tired of carrying weight or having to decide whether to take my laptop with me or not. This a long review so I've decided it into a few sections; the first one is personal and about why I decided to try out the laptop, it might be useful but feel free to skip it.<br /><br />Section I: Why I considered this laptop<br />  My first laptop was a 2011 apple macbook pro; a computer that I've grown to consider legendary by now (it'll be five years this fall and is still going very strong *knock on wood*). Before that laptop I had windows pc desktop's. My sony viao lasted the longest but felt slow after a few years (and cost $2000 at the time); my Dell crapped out entirely. My MBpro had a low resolution screen for the time but it was nice quality and the track pad and keyboard were spot on along with the processor. But most of all, my MBpro still feels like it can take whatever I usually throw at it; so I wanted my next computer to be a Mac. The main issue for me after transferring schools was the weight of my MBpro; 4.5 pounds is not a lot but carrying it around all day with my tight neck muscles became a real pain.<br />  I tried using a tablet but I found again and again found that I needed the speed and power of a full operating system (mathematica, quicker browsing, image editing, so on). Tablets are great, but with 20+ windows open, the sensitivity of a trackpad (you can cover the whole screen in 4inches) is necessary. With the tablets not sufficient for me and weight saving a big issue, I decided to invest in a new macbook; which one, however, was the main issue. I went and tried the new MacBooks and came to a very different conclusion than I expected; most of that is clear in the review that follows.<br /><br />Section 2: Initial Impressions<br />  Trying out the 12-inch MacBook next to the retina macbook pro 13 and 15 inch, it was clear that it was the 12 inch that was the vision of the future. Deceptively thin, incredibly light, the most beautiful screen I had ever seen (more about the screen in Section III) and a keyboard that made a delicious mechanical clack. Yet, everyone at the store and on many websites discouraged me from buying the 12-inch. Why? &#34;Too slow, too little travel, too small, more fashion than laptop, too few ports, definitely spend extra for the faster processers&#34; were the main comments. Perhaps these were notes worth considering but I felt quite strongly that they were simply missing the point. As the reviews came in about the second gen not fixing these issues, I began to feel more and more something had gone wrong. This is a minimalist laptop. Forget the displays, forget the usb, just let cloud services and bluetooth handle the rest. Most of all, only keep what is absolutely necessary on a laptop. I decided to put my money where my mouth was and purchased the 12-inch MacBook (I bought the core m3 because I didn't want to hear the &#34;oh, but that's an upgraded model&#34;) and after a few weeks of use have the following thoughts (will update as time goes on) and, by God, is it refreshing.<br /><br />Section III: Non-Work Use<br />  The next section is for work use. For watching videos, writing emails, and surfing website, this is easily the best laptop i have ever used. The keyboard has low travel but it is easy to get used to (anyone saying otherwise has some real brain plasticity issues) and the mechanical clack the keys make is scrumdiliumptious. The screen is the best quality screen I have personally ever seen (I won't lie, something about 2k on a 12 inch screen is just next level; I have a 10.5 inch Samsung Tab S but even with OLED it still doesn't have the oomph this screen does--I know, weird). Some photos and videos (google costa rica 4k on youtube) are beyond breathtaking. Text is clear and sharp as well. The sound is also great, the built is speaker has more bass than one would expect and the midrange is forward and present; again, absolutely top notch stuff. Additionally, the laptop is silent. No fan, no noise. It feels downright to be able to do as much work as one can on it and not hear a fan. Also, the force touch trackpad does the impossible and improves on a track pad that was near perfect.<br />  But what really sells this for daily use is its speed in opening apps. I found in the past that I used my macbook pro less and less for daily non-work activities because of the weight (compared to my iPhone) and waking it from sleep and opening apps took longer (10-12 seconds). This thing is on and waiting the second the screen opens, logs in near instantaneously and the apps are usually open within 3 seconds of a click. We are a spoiled people, I shouldn't be complaining that my old laptop takes 10 seconds longer to open things but it just somehow matters.<br />  Note, I don't mind waiting for things if they are made to take time. For example, when I am compiling mathematica code I expect to be able to take a break and check some websites; but if I am asking safari to open or word, I likely have something I want to get start on (in other words, once I am started a couple second in the middle are okay, but the apps and files need to be read for me). This will matter in the next section because I think core m processors are exactly the right compromise; they turbo to speed to get you what you need, then settle down at a lower ghz to finish the &#34;middle&#34; parts of many jobs.<br /><br />Section 4: Using the Laptop Professionally<br />  The weight, the weight, the weight. Say what you will, but I hate feeling weighed down by things. I have neck muscle issues and carrying even an extra pound can mean more pain than I care for. With my macbook pro I had to ask myself if I absolutely needed my laptop, with this that is never a question. This is the &#34;always with you&#34; laptop. Put it in your bad and forget about it. First of all, that immediately makes it better than 90% of laptops for me including my beloved 2011 MacBook Pro. The question is if the lightness is worth the other compromises.<br />  So, how does it feel work-performance wise? Well, it is way better than expected. As a graduate student I have a PS4 for games and I am more concerned with research in Safari and pdf readers than hardcore video edits and I can easily open many tabs and listen to music while having my mail and messages app open in the background. Sometimes, if I have a large PDF open it can become only slightly slower but its such a slight change that I just can't be bothered by it (also, the pdf's are so crisp and clear that I don't have room to complain). The ram is very quick and OS X tries to predict what you are going to do so it's faster; if you surprise it, again, somethings might be a tad slower, but we're really nitpicking here. But, then, it is also so so so much faster than my 2011 MBpro in many things. Sure, GeekBench scores say there are about equal, but the SSD means that Pages opens in 3-4 seconds while my MBpro took 13-15. Additionally, the screen is so crisp and clear that I can easily have Notes and Safari/PDF open in split view and still have resolution to spare (which, strangely, means that my 12 inch macbook's screen allows for more real estate than my 13.3 inch non-retina macbook pro). You might not think that is &#34;speed&#34; but being able to have two windows clearly open means that I don't have to scroll back and forth. That is time saved and exactly the sort of thing people miss when talking about a computers quickness.<br />  Would a 13.3 retina MBpro be faster? Well, of course, I've used them and they are fantastic; plus the newer one releasing in September will likely to be a monstrosity. If you are doing blackhole simulations, get that. If you are doing research reading papers, mathematica, image edits (depending on size, of course) and want a laptop that can actually always be with you, I don't see anything beating this.<br />  Also, a note about the core m3 processors. Yes, they are 1.1 ghz but it almost never has to dip down that low. I've used this as I normally use my laptops and only a couple of times has the processor gotten even near its full potential and, when it has, it is because some video and graphics intensive website were doing some downright unoptimized and nasty processor hogging (and I had way too many tabs playing anyway). My first reaction was: &#34;holy frijoles, how did they get these things to feel so zippy without any fans!).<br />  These processors are built to turbo to higher speeds, finish the job and come back down to more modest speeds (but even here modest is 1.5+ ghz). They can't stay up there like fan-cooled processors, but ask yourself: &#34;Do you really do work all the time that requires a processor to stay at 3.5 ghz?&#34; &#34;Really?&#34; Let me put it another way, if a core m3 isn't enough for you than you likely already know that; you're someone who knows that their workload is so processor heavy that you have skipped the core i5 and get the core i7 in every computer you have bought. For my work, the core m3 feels not just fast but reliable (forget the geek bench scores, that is a whole different story). And if someone is tasking their processor by doing basic activities, then its their sloppy habits that are to blame more so than the processor (surely we can be expected to change to get the best out of a laptop too?). The only difference I see between the core m3 and i5 is that the m3 sometimes asks you to give it a little more time to do SOME tasks (it says &#34;give me a second&#34; and never yells &#34;what the hell are you doing!!!&#34;). For the benefits of weight, complete silence, ergonomics and, when compared a whole, I don't feel the processor is a let down.<br />---------<br />Final Thoughts: I'll update and edit this review to be better, but I feel genuinely fortunate that the 12-inch macbook was everything I was expecting and more. It's light enough that it is always with you (thus making it &#34;practically&#34; faster than many other laptops). Its processor turbos when needed and settles down when it isn't and, more importantly, feels very zippy and reliable. It might take an extra-minute but it doesn't feel laggy or stressed when it does it. The keyboard clicks wonderfully, the force tough track pad is an improvement on near-perfection, and the sound is fantastic from the speakers.

"First off, there are converts and there are traitors.  To Apple - I am definitely a convert...to Microsoft however, I am a traitor.  I made the switch from Windows to Mac about 6 years ago, and I have never looked back.<br /><br />This is a review on the Apple Macbook<br />-13"" inch glossy screen<br />- 2.16 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo<br />- 1GB RAM<br />- 8x Superdrive DVD-R/RW/DL+RW/CD-R<br />- Bluetooth 2.0+EDR<br />- Airport Extreme Wireless 802.11n<br />- OSX 10.5 (Leopard)<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. SIZE - For me, a laptop is not my ideal desktop replacement.  I have a 20 inch iMac for that.  So, if I'm going to get a portable computer, it'd better be ""portable.""  Don't get me wrong, a 17"" screen I'm sure is gorgeous, but I am looking for maximum portability.  The 13"" Macbook is a perfect size laptop for any of my needs.  The glossy widescreen display is fantastic - clear as day, and it truly does give DVDs, home movies, and any other video a more realistic feel.<br /><br />2.  PROCESSOR - The intel Core 2 Duo running at 2.16 GHz is just as fast as I could hope for in a nice little 13"" body of a computer.  Of course we would all like more speed...but that comes with a price - more speed=higher temperatures, and less battery efficiency.  So though it is not a huge PRO, it's definitely not a CON for me.<br /><br />3.  OSX 10.5 - With the huge disappointment of Microsoft's Vista OS, I wouldn't be surprised to see more and more ""converts.""  It seems that with every OS that Apple releases, the quality control team was actually paying attention before they boxed it up and sent it to millions of consumers.  Leopard is Form and Function packed nicely and shipped with this Macbook.  The visuals of the OS are very elegant and refined (as all of OSXs iterations have been), and the additional features (Spaces, Time Machine) are definitely a welcomed addition).<br /><br />4. MagSafe Power Adaptor - A small, yet innovative feature. this power adapter is simply genius!  I will admit that I have tripped over my iBook's power cord in the past, and this has sent my laptop nearly tumbling off the desk.  Fortunately the wonderful wizards at Apple have skirted this problem for all the clumsy people out there (myself included).  The power cord is standard with the the 3-prong outlet, but where it differs is on the other end.  The cord simply is held to the computer by magnetic force alone.  This essentially creates a breakaway connection from the computer itself.<br /><br />5. Slot Loading Superdrive - I realize that Apple has been doing this since their Powerbook G3/G4 line, but it's still awesome.  There are too  many laptops out there that still use a tray.  Push a button, and a tray pops out...They all need to take a lesson from Apple and use slot loading drives from now on.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1. HARD DRIVE SPACE: This is my only true gripe.  I realize that I could have opted to pay for the extra large hard drive space, but the problem is that they are starting as low as 80GB to begin with.  This is on a machine that you can edit High Definition video with right out of the box (iMovie supports DV, HDV (high def video), MPEG 2, MPEG 4, and yes, even AVCHD formats) and you only give me a 120 GB hard drive?  This problem is easily fixed with the purchase of a portable external hard drive (like a WD Passport - that is now running up to 320 GB).<br /><br />2. intel GMA 950 GRAPHICS:  No one has marketed with Macbook as a gaming device - but that is not all you need a decent graphics card for.  Simply put, if you are running any sort of media editing software - be it iMovie, or Adobe CS, you still would do well to have a dedicated graphics chip of at least 256MB of VRAM.<br /><br />3. iLife 08 - There are a few things that I personally do not care for in the newest installment of iLife.  The grouping by events in iPhoto and iMovie are two of the major ones.  I lived my life for a year with the features I've come to know and love in iMovie HD and then they take all the functionality out of the program, pretty it up a little bit, and voila!  the newest iMovie.  I do realize that they are trying to make it as painless as possible to go from raw video to DVD, but they decided to forget about the user that likes all the bells and whistles and instead create a watered down version of iMovie HD.<br /><br />I can easily recommend a Macbook to anyone that asks.  I still have a iBook G3 and it still runs great - So I know that Apple makes quality products.  If you have the money I'd upgrade to a larger hard drive, and if you already own iLife 07, there is no need to update to iLife 08.",0.76,,0.15052521641463953,,Macbook

Please dont buy apple mac air. We had a 11 inch mac air. Within 1.5 years the screen turned white after the chime. Apple said it was the logic board that failed. Apple authorized retailer said it was the hard drive. To repair it Apple was going to charge 400-600 dollars as we did not buy apple care. Apple care is for 3 years only.

"I actually purchased this laptop from a Best Buy store, but the laptop is amazing. I got the rose gold color and I'm in love with it. I've never been a fan of the color pink but this shade is just amazing. The laptop itself has a great battery life, much better than expected. It's advertised as 10-12 hours but I've gotten closer to 15 hours out of it while connected to wifi. The Retina display if far superior than the display on any other laptop I've owned or used. The keyboard lights up enough that no matter the lighting I can always see the keys without blinding myself from looking at an overly bright keyboard. When I purchased the MacBook I was slightly concerned with the size of the trackpad, it seemed too large for the laptop, but after using it I noticed that it never got in the way and it's nice to have the room. The speakers blew my mind. Most laptops have a mediocre sound system at best, but the sound system on the MacBook actually sounds better than my Apple EarPods! I love that the MacBook is balanced so that I can open it with one hand without it tipping over, and if you close the top to about 45 degrees, it gently shuts itself instead of slamming closed. I thought the single USB-C port would be problematic (especially because I'm a college student) but I just had to buy a single (matching, of course) adapter and with that it has all the same ports that other laptops have. This laptop has no fans on the bottom, which is great because the noise is irksome, and the laptop looks much sleeker without a fan. At only 2lbs, I expected it to feel very fragile and delicate, but it seems surprisingly sturdy. I've used Windows my whole life, so the OS was new to me but after about 15 minutes of fiddling about I feel very comfortable with it. Overall, I am very happy with this laptop. IMHO, it's worth the steep steep price (but make sure you get insurance on it just in case because it's so expensive!)",0.86,,0.2602225108225108,,Macbook

"We bought a MacBook this spring and liked it so much we bought a 2nd for my son's HS graduation 2 months ago.  Both perform flawlessly.  However after only 2 months of NORMAL use the LCD screen on my son's Mac has cracked.  Apple quoted a base cost of $750 to replace--more than 2/3rds of the original cost!  (Actually, they said ""Don't fix; buy a new unit."") I was quick to blame my son for misuse, but now I'm uncertain if that is fair.  I have found many blogs reporting the same fragile LCD cracks on MacBooks, many which seemed to occur spontaniously.  Apple, of course, claims misuse and will not warranty.  Even the additional Apple Care warranty excludes LCD replacement.  Perhaps the cover design inadequately protects the screen. Think twice.  Or at least buy a hard snap on case which may provide some protection.",0.74,,0.17759890572390571,,Macbook

"I believe this is a discontinued model and most people would probably order the [[ASIN:B001P05NJC latest version of this MacBook]] (unless this one is available for a lower price).  But actually, I believe the [[ASIN:B001P05NKG 2009 13-inch MacBook Pro]] is worth the higher price for the following reasons:<br /><br />- it's a little faster<br />- it's a little lighter<br />- the aluminum finish is more durable<br />- the all metal body should dissipate heat better<br />- the large glass trackpad is more durable<br />- multi-touch gestures make it easier to navigate<br />- keyboard lights up at night<br />- expands up to 8GB of memory (useful for the future)<br />- longer battery life<br />- the matte aluminum finish with black keys is beautiful<br /><br />For me, these features justify the extra cost, which is why I purchased the Pro -- others might not feel they are important.  I am writing this review mostly so people thinking about the white MacBook at least consider the Pro version before making a final purchase.<br /><br />Note -- I got the least expensive of the 13-inch MacBook Pro which has slightly lower processor speed, smaller disk and just 2GB of RAM.  The processor speed on the more expensive model is nice, but it's not significantly faster and the disk and memory can be upgraded later when prices drop (I eventually will get a solid-state drive and 8GB).",0.8400000000000001,,0.10236042692939247,,Macbook

"It's now eight days since I got my new MacBook ""white"" after more than 4 months reading and searching to get convinced enough to do that move, and pew I did it :)<br /><br />Let's start with the hardware specifications, it has 13.3 inch widescreen with (LED backlight technology) this extra-awesome hyper saturated colors. (I read a few articles about LED backlighting and it differs from the old CCFL screens, you can read more about that here [...] ). And it has an Intel 2.4Ghz Core 2 Duo processor with 4 megabytes L3 cache, 160GB 5400RPM SATA (low-noise) disk, 2.27kg weight, 5 hours-long battery and Airport Wireless card that supports 802.11n technology with awesome reception accuracy and iSight camera.<br /><br />The most astonishing thing for now is the Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard 64bit, AWESOME operating system, and I can really understand now why apple always said that it's the most advanced operating system in the world, they are right, it's. :) it's a very well designed for a great user experience and you'll see many snapshots in the next few posts and well. it has more than 300 new features over the previous version ""Tiger 10.4' and the main thing you'll notice about mac is that it's a REAL FAST.<br /><br />The great news is that most of the well known and famous applications I needed are available for mac, like microsoft office and it's open source clone open office, adobe creative suite 3, yahoo messenger, MSN messenger and iChat works as an awesome jabber chat client.<br /><br />The first thing I'm so happy about is that I chose The white model. That's because the surface is very finger-print catching and can be easily scratched, but happily the white color hides most of it.<br /><br />Also, it's really fast.<br /><br />I use it mostly for music, internet, pictures, movies, homework pretty much what everybody uses a computer for. Also, I use it for my research, extensive statistics work and various medical work, and it works great<br /><br />iLife is awesome and so is leopard (find out at apple.com)<br /><br />like when you turn on your pc it has load and load and load then when the desktop finally pops up then if you click on something it takes like 1/2 an hour to open up<br /><br />on this laptop it loads and and when the desktop shows you click something and it actually opens like its supposed to<br /><br />I have been using pcs all my life and i just got fed up with them.<br /><br />It is very nice computer to use especially during presentations (Apple Keynote is Awesome, especially, its presenter mode).<br /><br />Spotlight is very effective tool for searching for papers. Also, there are limitless possibilities and solutions for scientific purposes.<br /><br />Finally,<br /><br />Advantages:<br /><br />1- Very Fast.<br />2- Reliable computer.<br />3- Can run windows and mac osx applications (I use VMWare as a virtual machine).<br />4- Lots of tools for your research (example ofr nice software for research: Sente, Papers, Endnote, Yep, ...etc).<br />5- Stylish.<br />6- Perfect Screen.<br />7- Good Battery Life.<br />8- Durable (I dropped it twice).<br />9- Nice for chatting and communication (It's isight integration is flawless).<br />10- Perfect software and hardware integration.<br /><br />Disadvantages:<br /><br />1- Needs more RAM (At least 2 GB Ram).<br />2- Speakers are not so strong.<br /><br />Finally,<br /><br />It is a perfect laptop for a graduate student for the price.",0.82,,0.37466340422862165,,Macbook

"Always have used Garmin with my Android, worked great. A year ago switch to iphone(was offered one free). Well Garmin for me was a hit or miss.

Still have a learning curve but I'm happy with it. The  thing the Garmin had was battery life, also apple data is a great deal more detailed. Also like that the 6 is smaller(40mm) and thinner.

While it is not quite strong enough to charge any Macbook (you need a 65w charger for that) this does the job as great as it can.<br /><br />I highly 100 percent recommend this for literally any iPhone owner that has an iPhone 8, 8 Plus, SE (2020), X, XR, XS, XS Max, 11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max, 12 series. all iPad Pro, Pad Air (3rd generation and later) and iPad mini (5th generation and later).",0.96,27.3,0.3327301587301587,0.6528519214703425,iPhone
"I recently purchased the Apple USB-C to Lightning Cable (2 m) and am thrilled with its performance. This cable has exceeded my expectations regarding speed, durability, and overall quality.<br /><br />Firstly, the length of the cable is perfect for my needs. At 2 meters, charging my Apple devices without staying next to the wall socket gives me plenty of flexibility. This is incredibly convenient when I am working on my laptop and need to charge my iPhone or iPad simultaneously.<br /><br />Moreover, the cable is high-speed at charging my devices. I was blown away by how quickly it captured my iPhone 12 and was even more impressed with the speed of charging my iPad Pro. The USB-C to Lightning technology is genuinely a game-changer regarding charging times.<br /><br />In terms of durability, this cable is built to last. The braided design of the line gives it a strong and sturdy feel, which gives me peace of mind that it won't easily break or fray like other cables I've used in the past. In addition, the Lightning connector is securely attached to the line and fits perfectly into my devices without looseness or wobbling.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend the Apple USB-C to Lightning Cable (2 m) to anyone who wants a high-quality and reliable charging cable for their Apple devices. It may be more expensive than other cables on the market, but the superior performance, durability, and convenience of this cable make it well worth the investment.",0.96,17.0,0.32750000000000007,0.6517426900584795,iPhone

"Quality Rating: 3/5<br />Based on price: 4/5<br />Time with Product: 4 years (purchased in 2017)<br /><br />Review:<br />I have had this mouse for 4 years and I stopped using it 3 years ago. I still have it lying on my shelf. You see it started off great and worked perfectly. However, after 6 months-year, it began malfunctioning. If I held it slightly up it would disconnect from my MacBook Pro. That literally made it unusable. I cannot tolerate sudden bluetooth disconnections. Therefore, I stopped using it. Simple.<br /><br />When it did work, it was phenomenal and it really is good apple product. I just wouldn't trust to buy it renewed from anywhere. Please do yourself a favor and purchase it new from Apple or Amazon. The investment is much more worth it, and you can garuntee that there wasn't someone else who used it before and ruined it or broke it without you realizing it. Not even that, but technology dies with time by itself. It essentially denatures. Therefore, I would recommend you buy it new so that you can take full advantage of its life expectancy before it dies and begins to malfunctions on you.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review!<br />If there are any questions or concerns please contact me, I am happy to help.<br />Email - ramit6782@gmail.com<br /><br />Have fun shopping! :)<br />- Rami Taha",0.8400000000000001,56.0,0.3954040404040403,0.6439929558745348,iPhone

"I love mechanical keyboards, so when my job decided it was time to start working in the office again, I knew I had to get a good TKL wireless keyboard to keep in my office. Since this is staying at work, I didn't want to build something, or spend a whole lot of money on it. So after doing some Reddit research, I decided on this Royal Kludge model. I really wasn't expecting much, but holy cow! This thing is so good for how little it costs!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Feels heavy and sturdy<br />Battery life is excellent, especially with RGB off.<br />Good wireless range.

They are thick and not overly clacky<br />RK Brown switches are better than I expected. If you're a keyboard enthusiast, these will annoy you, but normal users should be totally happy with these switches.<br />Backlighting is nice and bright<br />Built in back feet for adjusting angle.<br />Removable bezel is a nice touch. Not something I will likely use, but a nice touch nonetheless<br /><br />Cons:<br />Stabilizers are just ok, not great. A little rattley, could definitely benefit from modding.<br />Instruction manual is... not great.<br />RGB is limited, and not great quality.<br />Software - it works, but is a little clunky. Also, I didn't see anywhere on this page or the instructions that said you have to be in wired mode to use the software, but you do.<br />Software (again) - you have to download it from Google drive. I understand hosting costs money, but come on, that's the sketchiest possible way to distribute software. I can attest though, after thorough testing, that the software is clean and totally safe.<br /><br />Overall I'm incredibly impressed. I will probably switch out the switches and stabilizers at some point, but for now I am really enjoying using this keyboard right out of the box!",0.9,69.74,0.23637755102040817,0.5804709392528942,iPhone

This turns out to not be less of problem than I thought it might because once you set the volume, with the noise canceling, you don't need to adjust them, and you can leave the volume at an ear saving level.

"Finally splurged for this pencil after using soft tipped, non-accurate stylus‚Äôs for years. Below is my feedback. Note that I have an iPad Pro 3rd generation tablet.<br /><br />- accuracy is excellent. Regular cheap stylus‚Äôs are difficult to select particular letters of words, and they aren‚Äôt good at copying and pasting. Apple Pencil does this extremely well!<br /><br />- controlling YouTube fast forward or back is so much easier using this pencil vs my fat finger.<br /><br />- pencil feels so comfortable in your hand. To me, the perfect diameter.<br /><br />- pencil length is also great as it allows me to reach everywhere on my iPad screen.<br /><br />- the tip of the pencil is pointy but smooth. Won‚Äôt damage your screen if you don‚Äôt have a glass protective cover. And, the thinness of the tip fits perfectly between letters when you want to make a selection.<br /><br />-  battery lasts a very long time.<br /><br />-  recharging the pencil by magnetically attaching to the top of your iPad makes the process so easy!<br /><br />- you will not be able to swipe up using the pencil to bring up open apps nor can you access control center from the upper right hand corner. I can live with this but I hope a software update in the future addresses this.<br /><br />- now the major flaw! You can‚Äôt use this pencil on your iPhone. I have an 11 pro max and it‚Äôs so disappointing that Apple didn‚Äôt make the pencil work on iPhone. For the cost of this item I find that to be unacceptable! Apple, if you are reading these reviews make the next generation pencil work with iPhone!!!<br /><br />However, I still highly recommend this item for use with your iPad.",0.9400000000000001,89.0,0.20925385770143837,0.5760933031197251,iPhone

"I‚Äôve been meaning to replace my old AirPods for a year now. The battery life was ending‚Ä¶ I kept shopping for all different Earbuds, reading reviews, and asking friends and finally broke down and decided to try the most expensive, but best reviewed earbuds, AirPods Pro.<br /><br />You bet 100% that I made the absolute right decision!!! These are amazing!!! First is the fit! You barely notice them in your ears, which I areas other earbuds can get uncomfortable after a while. Second is the sound!!! The Spacial Audio of the Pros is incredible and 3x the quality of my old AirPod 2s!!! Third is ease of use. I used to have adaptors that I‚Äôd put on and take off the old AirPods because they would fall out of my ears without. They also sync so easily with my iPhone and I‚Äôve yet to have any Bluetooth interference which my old AirPods would often cut out and skip for who knows why.<br /><br />I got the Pros at $179 off Amazon during the Christmas sale season. They are now back to $199, but I would pay it if I had to!!!<br /><br />AirPods Pro‚Äôs are absolutely the best earbuds ever!!! Especially a must if you have an iPhone.",0.9400000000000001,249.99,0.24397688859494412,0.5699182688588755,iPhone
"For reference I purchased the item 'Wireless Earbuds made in China' E10 $20 after coupon (left, white, smallest case), Air Pods Pro $175 (2nd left, white), Pixel Buds Pro $200 (2nd right, black), Bose SoundSport $109 (right, black, wired). All tested using a Pixel 6 to play the music.<br /><br />I received Google Pixel Buds for my birthday this month. I will say they had excellent touch controls, better than Apple's and Google assistant was always on point. I'd imagine best wireless battery life too, marginally better than Apple. Probably the best noise cancelling I've ever had plus transparency mode is nice and easy to switch between. Even better than my, albeit older, Bose Quiet Comfort 25 over the ear wired headphones. Just can't stand how quickly these come out of my ears, the fit is like the tip of an adult thumb to the first knuckle shoved vertically in your ear. Also noted as the best bass. Pixel buds did connect easily to a Pixel 6 phone, a littleore difficult to connect to a laptop but they did.<br /><br />I bought my wife AirPods Pro for her birthday earlier this year. AirPods are definitely more comfortable than the E10 knock offs, but E10 are close with minimal activity. Airpods aren't perfect, and will still fall out running or jumping for kids... I'd rather drop the E10s for the price. Sound quality is better than Google but not as good as my Bose, not as much bass as the pixel buds but Apple has far superior overall sound quality than the Pixel Buds. The touch controls do work, I do have some issues squeezing the right spot but I'm getting older and have fatter fingers than when I was in my 20s. I found Pixel Buds touch controls to be a little better. My wife uses these with her laptop (windows) at work for meetings more than her phone. They connected easier with her iPhone 13, but I did connect them to a Pixel 6 and her laptop fairly easily. AirPods charging case feels the most durable with a metal hinge, plus wireless charging works good. Noise cancelling is good and it has transparency mode, I think Google may be a tad better.<br /><br />Bose SoundSport have the BEST fit of any ear buds I've ever worn. So tight, I've actually pulled the cord loose from my phone instead of out of both my ears. Also the most comfortable since it's all a rubberish material touching your ear that sort of forms to your ear. Plus Bose have the best overall sound, but AirPods are very close. I will admit pixel buds have the most bass of any of these 4. Actually these 2015 released ear buds have the weakest bass of any of the 4 being reviewed. These are wired and still expensive, and now hard to find reasonably priced in 2022. I have used them hard and they keep on trucking. I will continue to use them if the battery is dead in my E10s. More and more devices are lacking an auxiliary port to connect to, I currently have an adapter for auxiliary to USB-C to use with a Pixel 6 phone, which also does work on my laptop.<br /><br />These E10s have better overall sound than Pixel Buds Pro. More bass than my (very old) Bose SoundSport headphones. Smallest charging case for wireless, also cheapest feel and the hinge wouldn't stay open when laid down. Touch controls also suck the most, I did get volume up to work, sometimes volume down. Non existent noise cancelling. Only says noise cancelling in the name on the manual, no where in the manual. Mic must work fine, Google assistant heard me clear. I haven't tested a call. These are the only headphones to come with a charging cord, no brick to plug into the wall, but USB-C to USB. My Pixel 6 charger with the official Google brick did charge this.<br /><br />Bottom line. I'm returning $200 Pixel Buds Pro for the $20 E10s... And I will settle for my wired Bose if these don't have battery. I couldn't justify buying currently priced $179 AirPods at the time of this review for my Pixel 6. Plus my wife won't let me keep her birthday gift.<br /><br />Time will tell if the upcoming Pixel watch is a success or a failure. I may be converting to Apple if the watch flops.

"A relatively bright feature of the iphone12 generation is magnetic charging, which can solve the problem of inaccurate wireless charging positioning in the past.<br />Advantages: You can suck very tightly without any phone case, you can also suck very tightly with Apple's own phone case, or you can hang the phone in the air. The workmanship is beautiful. You can pick up your phone and charge it wirelessly while playing. The wireless magnetic charger can be separated with one hand.<br />Disadvantages: A very important issue is that magnetism does not just throw the phone over and suck it, but needs to be aligned artificially, which greatly affects the experience. The use of third-party phone cases will weaken the magnetic attraction of the phone, which can be said to be completely weak. Larger volume, better if smaller. It would be better if there was an Apple logo on the back. The charging speed is a bit slow, it would be better if the charging speed can be accelerated.

Samsung and Fitbit will just record without having to do anything, although Fitbit you have to pay for an app.<br /><br />As for the app (Health), every so often it will just stop working or freeze.

"Yes, I want to start by saying that Apple could have been more straightforward in saying that the wall charging block needs to be USB-C and at least 20W.<br />The original iPhone small ""square"" block was 2W, maybe 5W if my memory is correct.<br />The iPad charging block at the wall is 12W.<br /><br />I have been using 15-20W charging blocks and USB-C to Lightning for various uses since I got my 12 Pro Max.<br />It is an inconvenience to have to get a 20W charging block to go along with this, but to free up the lightning port and have it stick to the back is a luxury, not to mention that I have at least 2 20W or higher blocks, and people who bought a phone that was this expensive, having to spend $20 should not be surprising or overwhelming by any amount. USB-A cannot carry this much power, and so a USB-C wall block paired with this Magsafe Charger really is something special.<br /><br />I don't think that so many highly rated reviews stating $20 ruined the product should be what people focus on.

"After owning my air pod pros for nearly two years now I feel that I am qualified to give an accurate and in-depth review over this popular product. I originally bought them due to my right original air pod dying, so naturally since I liked the first once I decided to go onto the next ones. I have used them for all the most common activities that the average headphone user does such as: working out, traveling, studying, and general use to listen to music or podcasts. Considering my time of ownership and widespread use of them I feel that I am qualified to tell you the pros and cons as well as why I think you should pick up your own pair of air pod pros.<br />If you have owned the previous generation of air pods or any other apple product, then you will find that the pros come in the typical apple packaging which keeps the headphones and accessories secure and in good condition upon opening. Out of the box you will have the air pods themselves inside the portable charging case, as well as a usb-c charging cable (an upgrade from the usb-a in the original air pods), instructions, an apple sticker, and a few interchangeable sized silicon ear tips to fit best into your ear. To set them up simply open the case (the air pods will already be partially charged when you get them) and open you iPhone and a button will pop up to connect them. Next apple will take you through a sizing test to get a crisp and comfortable fit in your ear. As mentioned, the pros fit differently than the original air pods which is great for those who found the plastic design didn‚Äôt cater to their ears. Now with 3 different sized silicon tips buyers can find a snug personalized fit. The silicon tips also help introduce the new and biggest feature of the pros being Noise cancellation and transparency mode. The noise cancellation works very well when you need to tune out outside noise to focus, study, or are trying to sleep on an airplane.  Sometimes I find myself putting them in without playing anything simply to make the surrounding are quieter. The transparency mode conversely also works well to help you hear the surrounding area which is great if your study buddy needs to talk to you, or you want to hear things around you on a run or bike ride.<br />Now that we covered some of the highlights let‚Äôs review some of the negative. The sound quality is good, however, if you are a self-proclaimed ‚Äúaudiophile‚Äù then they made not be the earbuds for you as there is better quality out there. I found that it lacks some of the base that I personally prefer, but the mids and highs both sound good. Additionally, I found them to be just good and not great for working out. When trying to wear them to run I found that sweat often caused them to fall out and I even lost one in a stream once while running and had to replace it. There are aftermarket tips you can put on them to fight this, but I think something like the Beats powerbeat pros suit an active user needs more with the hook around ear design. Finally, the price for these is a bit steep at $250 although right now they are on sale for $180. Overall, I think that these are the best earbuds on the market right now and worth your money.",0.9400000000000001,249.99,0.22704580365870694,0.5614527263907569,iPhone

If you read the really, tiny fine print on the item page, you'll see that ""For optimum charging, the Apple Cplug (?) is ALSO required!!"". it's easily missed while reading about the other product features. True to form, Apple has done it again.  I (foolishly) made the assumption that it would be a USB to plug into one of the thousands of Apple plugs I already own. NOPE.

The case itself is good quality and is crystal clear but the buttons are hard to push and it feels like the phone is going to fall out of your hands because it‚Äôs so slick. I came from using an apple leather case on my old iPhones and the buttons felt much easier to push and they were better quality. I returned this case and bought an apple leather case for a replacement. I would have thought Apple would‚Äôve done a better job on a clear case.

Yea, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really worth it.

With that said, you would have to purchase one of Apple‚Äôs MagSafe cases made for the iPhone 12, that will run you a good $50.  So by the time you are done trying to be cool with the new fancy MagSafe charger, you will have spent $110 plus tax.

"I just got this yesterday to charge my new Iphone 13 pro max. I was a little upset that the brick wasn't with it. But I had to order one anyway because it doesn't come with your new Iphones either. I ordered the Apple 20W USB-C Power Adapter - iPhone Charger with Fast Charging Capability, Type C Wall Charger to go with it and so far, so good. I have a clear plastic case on my phone and it is charging very well. I have another phone case coming that is magsafe, and I can let you know later in an update how this works out. But for now, with just a plain clear case, the charger sticks to the case and phone fine. I wouldn't be picking it up and swinging it around because the phone would go flying, but it is on there nicely for a charge. Not slipping around. Also, I stuck it directly to my phone, and it clamped down really well. I used my fingernail to lift it off. I didn't want to scratch my phone. I wouldn't pull it off by the cord. That will eventually break it off. And it is a shame that we have to buy these products now instead of them coming with our new phones. So be careful removing you charger.

"By far the nicest looking case you can buy for this phone. I‚Äôve bought tons and tons of cases in my life for all the different iPhone models that have come out, but I always seem to make my way back to these. Apple does an excellent job at designing a case to perfectly fit the form of the body. I normally buy 2-3 of these with every model I get. Never interferes with any screen protectors and gives the phone a ton of grip! The bottom is left exposed, mainly to avoid the sound from the speakers to be compromised. If you ever drop it from a decent height or onto a rough surface, it will put a nice gash into the case. I‚Äôve purchased this type of case for every Apple product they make it for, and only once did the case not at least protect the device from a drop (happened to me on an iPad.) I would avoid the black colored case, as it seems to show wear way too soon.

"After getting my new iPhone 11, I purchased this charger. The charger was great and definitely charged my phone quicker than the normal Apple charger, however; after using the charger for about 4 months, I began to notice the battery life of the iPhone seemed to be getting shorter.

The study is for people over 65, and not all participants get access to the watch discount, since some are randomly chosen as a control population.<br /><br />I wear the watch except during sleep.

"First thing, yes this case is a bit slippery, and if you are one to drop your iPhone I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it, but if you, like me, tend to have a solid grip on your phone this case is really nice. Most clear cases are more grippy and are made with a softer plastic but feel a little cheap (in my experience)...but the apple clear case feels premium and shows off the color really well. I only just received my case so I can‚Äôt comment on the finger print issue but again most clear cases have this issue to varying degrees.

"The standard silicone earbud tips are worthless for secure fit and long-term comfort.

Beware, however, of having these laying around outside of their charging case.  The iPhone will think you are using them and will often route calls to the Airpod Pro buds even if they are not inserted in your ears.<br /><br />Battery life sucks.  Using noise cancellation, I'm lucky to get 4 hours.  They do recharge quickly in their case, at least giving another hour or so with only 10 minutes in the case.

"I ordered this Apple Pencil in anticipation for my new IPad Air 4 back in March 2021. It was marked as ‚Äúnew‚Äù, I paid full price ($130). It worked fantastically for most of the next 17 months. When the pencil was not in my hand, it was attached to the side of my iPad Air 4. It kept a 100% charge all the time when I wasn‚Äôt using it. I draw in Procreate, Illustrator, and Photoshop and I am an avid note taker so I‚Äôm always aware of the battery level of both devices.<br /><br />I always plugged my iPad in every night to charge or at my desk first thing in the morning while I worked. I always checked the Pencil. If it was ever detached for whatever reason, I connected it and observed it was at or near 100% every time. A few minutes later it was back to a full charge.<br /><br />Fast forward to August 2022.  The Apple Pencil suddenly stopped charging. Over the next few days, it failed to charge and died for the first time. It would intermittently charge. Every few days, it appeared to charge to 100% and seemed to be fine. A few days of sporadic use I would notice the Apple Pencil was not charging (I still kept the Pencil attached and the iPad charged). Then magically it would charge again after forgetting the Pencil and reconnecting several times. Then it would sporadically not maintain a charge.<br /><br />I was busy with a lot of important projects during this time so this was low priority in my life. Finally at the last week of September it refused to charge at all. It would charge enough to connect via Bluetooth (only briefly) then disconnect.<br /><br />I took it and my iPad to the local Best Buy (an Apple Authorized Service Provider) and they diagnosed it with a bad battery that would not charge. The tech asked me when I purchased the Pencil and I indicated ‚ÄúMarch 2021‚Äù so he was checking for any warranty that may be active. He checked the Serial Number against an Apple database and told me it was originally purchased in January 2021.<br /><br />I bought a new Pencil and got a used Pencil? It seemed to work fine for over a year. But I‚Äôm left wondering why it suddenly stopped charging? What could‚Äôve been wrong with it to have the Pencil last for so long then stop working? Are Apple Pencils notorious for just not being a good product?<br /><br />Granted, I had the device for one year and a number of months but I did not expect it to crap out on me so quickly. I have a 15 year old Wacom stylus and tablet that still work. I have an iPhone 6S Max that still works (not my daily driver, but still). My 37 year old NES works like it‚Äôs 1985. I take great care of my technology.<br /><br />I took care of it and followed the directions (especially didn‚Äôt get it wet or feed it after midnight). I took it on vacation this summer and it stayed in the room. Not even around water or sand. Yet here was a $130 aluminum and plastic stick that was useless. Like a fool, I did not purchase an Apple Care plan for the Pencil (my mistake). And it was apparently used when I bought it. Amazon lied.<br /><br />I spent $130 on another one at Best Buy that day (much to the chagrin from my wife) and I shouldn‚Äôt have had to do that. I could see if I treated it poorly and did not keep it charged but that was not the case.<br /><br />Amazon sold me a used Pencil that may have had a defect. I double checked my order to make sure I did not buy a refurbished or used Pencil (I did not). And since it worked for almost 18 months‚Ä¶probably nothing I can do.",0.9400000000000001,89.0,0.08415200391006843,0.5135423762240401,iPhone

I went for the smaller 40mm size given that I have smaller wrist and it basically holds a charge for an entire day with moderate use.

I purchased this charger for my iPhone 12. In the beginning it did not work (Not sure what the problem was but Apple had issues with chargers not working on my model phone). Months later after the iPhone Apple software update the charger began to work! My only drawback is the length of the cord is short. It also does not come with an adapter/plug that goes into the wall socket which is not included in this package.

"I bought an iPad Pro 12.9&#34; as an experimental laptop replacement, and buying this made all the difference. Some people reported not liking the feel; I actually really enjoy it. It's very quiet and the completely covered keys make for easy cleaning. It holds the iPad at only one angle in typing position, and although it's not exactly the angle I'd use for a MacBook screen, I haven't had any serious issues with it, either.<br /><br />If it's a drain on iPad battery power, it isn't significant enough to notice. (And, compared to external keyboards that need their own power sources, the fact this runs off iPad power - and very little of it - is worth the price difference alone. Between the iPad, my iPhone 7+, and an Apple Pencil, not to mention a Garmin Fenix 3 GPS running watch, I have enough chargers to worry about without having to worry about a keyboard charger, too.<br /><br />And yes, there's no backlight, but I don't look at my fingers when I type, and if I DID need to look, the iPad ambient light usually provides enough visibility for those times when I'm typing in the dark. Which aren't many. I still say not having to charge the thing outweighs a lack of backlighting. If you really need a lit-up keyboard, it doesn't get any brighter than the one on the screen. Just saying. :)<br /><br />The ONLY thing I don't like about this (and all Apple SmartCovers) is that the microfiber surface that comes in contact with your screen when the cover is completely closed is the same surface that makes contact with the desk, the kitchen counter, or whatever surface you happen to put it on. So you wind up potentially transferring a lot of crumbs, dog fur, dust, etc. from surfaces to your screen.

My husband has one, so I'm using his with it, but it's frustrating.  Also, this thing is heavy, really heavy!  I got the smaller face because I have small wrists, and this barely fits on the flat of my wrist as it is.  And the bulge in the back where it connects to the skin for sensing is somewhat uncomfortable but I think I will get used to it.  I don't want a gazillion apps on it and apparently I cannot delete some of them that I will never use (that's not awesome Apple, thanks!)  I am not a huge fan of Apple's UIs generally and this watch fits right in there.  Haven't figured out yet how to use the ECG feature, but that's one of the reasons I got it, so I will have to spend some quality time reading the manual (on my husband's iPhone, again, awesome Apple, so nice they make it so hard to download the manual onto a PC trying to force us to assimilate).

PROS: The use of the magnet means less shifting the phone around to get it properly aligned.  It charges without taking the case off my iPhone 12 mini.  CONS: USB-C connecter meant that I had to purchase a AC power adapter to plug it in at home.

Was super excited to get my watch but when I opened it the box with the watch face and charger was empty as shown in pics.  Called to get it corrected and they won‚Äôt send an actual watch. I have to wait for ups to pick up what is essentially a 400$ watch band and empty box.  Then wait for them to receive the box to then wait up to 14 days from receiving return to get refunded and ultimately figure out if I‚Äôm going to risk ordering another empty box.  In my opinion they should over night a watch once ups confirms they picked it up. I was going to utilize the EKG feature as I have heart issues and my Samsung won‚Äôt work with this new iPhone. Sham on Apple for sending an empty box for 400$ and then to follow with poor customer service that forces me to be at their whim to get my money back.

"[[VIDEOID:ac5ec26cf56d951dcca12498460dcc72]] I am truly disheartened by the poor quality of services from both Apple and Amazon. I ordered a MagSafe Charger on July 11th. It arrived defective.

The replacement arrived on August 9th. And guess what? It's defective again!<br /><br />I might have a streak of bad luck, but receiving two faulty items in a row is beyond my usual misfortune.

"Having never owned an iPod I have to say that I am extremely disappointed in the performance.  (The Seller Was Fine, no problems there, except I didn't receive any paperwork in the box - NOTHING)  Bu sincet I Own an iPhone4, and settings are similar I expected this to perform similarly in charging, uploading, downloading etc. and it simply does not.<br /><br />I have not spoken to any other iPod owners to see if this is a common problem .... takes about 3 hours to fully charge from 1/2 (takes my iPhone 45 minutes)...  took about 1.75 hours to download a movie from my Amazon Prime to watch while travelling (my iPhone in 8 minutes)  .... took 45 minutes to download ONE song from my Amazon Prime (iPhone in 2-3 minutes) ......  (**oh and I had the iPod sitting directly on top of my modem to see if that would move it along faster, it didn't)  ....and in watching or listening it will completely discharge the battery in less than an hour ... so the majority of my use I have it plugged in which can be inconvenient at times.  Also, the battery begins discharging (even when I have turned it off) immediately ..  so, like last night I plugged it up about 9pm ... the charger automatically stops when an item is full charged .... it is now about 10:20am and it is as dead as if I had NEVER charged it, when I just turned it on for the first time today!  (and Yes, I slid the bar to shut off after plugging it in)<br />I have gone into settings and am totally baffled that no matter how I adjust it that nothing seems to fix these aggravating things ...

"I do a lot of reviews via Amazon and many other platforms via my profession in tech. I come in contact with many sellers and products. Putting that out there, this one is a very mixed bag for me and I really hope this review will help someone out with these types of purchases in particular. This seller is ‚Äú Reuse ‚Äú .<br />  When buying used Macs , I‚Äôve learned a lot especially off of Amazon, the seller 100% makes the difference,  as well as doing your homework on them,  and the product itself. That will pay off in the end ,  know what you want , know what the price is and what it should be and know there will be a mark up and what that markup should be. The used Mac game is dirty one. There are more cons than pros and lots of gouging over trivial features especially color , I‚Äôve seen a $150 mark up over color in my opinion that‚Äôs a very dirty play, these aren‚Äôt iPhones , they are Macs , granted this seller did not do that, that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm saying  but many do.<br />  I‚Äôm my situation, I got this Space gray Mac, Mid 2018, 2.2ghz Intel 6core I-7 gpu Radeon 545 , 256SSD after tax it was about $681 no warranty offered so let‚Äôs say $700 rounded up  (this will matter later) Well , first impressions where great honestly as they actually had it boxed up very nice and the laptop was protected in a little bubble sleeve as seen in the picture , it was simplistic. It was not  crushed , beat up , and it was taken care of via delivery as well as their packing.which was a good start , so great job there. There could‚Äôve been a tad more cushion , maybe like popcorn in the bubble wrap that had it in , let‚Äôs be honest we as a consumer or a small business are spending a lot of money and the product should be protected well,  seeing as you or I just dropped $700-$1000k right ?.  So, That‚Äôs where the good impression ended unfortunately and things being great.<br />  As soon as I opened the box before I even got into booting the Mac and wiping the drive and updating the software , I was not happy with the laptop. It  looked like it has been thrown around , literally. I added a few pictures but that isn‚Äôt the worst of it As I only took a few photos for the seller to get a small visual of how bad it came and  to get a immediate refund issued. I‚Äôll touch on the conversation and customer service in a bit. The Mac looked as if was dropped on concrete (who really knows) in some spots there was  small chunks of pitting obviously from impact on a porous surface. Lots of scratches and even a decent sized dent or two. Obviously disappointment set in as it was the year and color I wanted and I was on a deadline most importantly and needed this Mac to get to work as my last Mac went down which is what brought me here in the first place .<br />  Well after boot the drive had issues in general lots of buggy behavior, updating to Ventura was a struggle for it, it came on High Sierra , (this laptop is fully capable & compatible for the newest macOS fyi without the M1/M2 chipsets) but I never even bothered to wipe or update the drive and move forward as more issues arose fast. It only has 4 type C ports . That‚Äôs it . Well one port was dead , left rear and then another had a connectivity and voltage issue. The keyboard and trackpad were about the only nice things or had a nice feel, there were scratches around the chassis and bezels of the display which was already affecting the display and would have been a issue in the future undoubtedly. SO, to basically get this moving forward the Mac was not worth the price and fairly beat up for what I paid. You expect some issues when buying used , I could live with that but not after the conversation with the seller.<br />  Now, In all fairness, this seller was not impolite nor unprofessional however they really had a take it or leave it type of attitude via our lengthy conversation that I will touch on a bit now as I don‚Äôt want to be tacky.  I would never leave screenshots or direct quotes out of respect and courtesy for people. Although the encounter left me asking over and over ‚Ä¶.what happened  to customer service ?<br />  I need to start with I let them know of  the issues and the first response was basically if you are not happy with, it send it back and sorry about your luck. Ok, fair play, I can handle that type of response.  My issue was they really tripped over what they said throughout the convo as they stated I bought a ‚Äúas is product‚Äù but it‚Äôs also listed as Amazon renewed/refurbished. HERE IS WHERE I NEED FOLKS TO PAY ATTENTION, ITS IMPORTANT.<br />  There is a disconnect between Amazon and 3rd party sellers which this was and gives a very EBay type of buying situation and that‚Äôs is a bad look for Amazon. After stating the issues and speaking to Amazon a rep named Ariana (very nice) come to find out Amazon never touched this product, nor did their quality control team , they did not see or have hands on this product , there techs that look over the product to diagnose the in this case Laptop and make sure it meets the Amazon renewed/refurbished promise never touched it, they never had it in there facility or hands to assure  everything was in working order. Amazon never saw this product. It was all handled in the store of the seller which is a 3rd party, they told me straight forward which I can appreciate honesty but the laptop wasn‚Äôt tested fully on their end and admitted. That‚Äôs a issue. They tested a port as in a single port  to make sure it charged and moved on, they didn‚Äôt test all the ports, which is a partial quote. Well there is only 4 ports I said, I‚Äôm gonna say that‚Äôs a very important overlook,  not only that,‚Ä¶ but if you didn‚Äôt bother to check all 4 ports , what else did you not check ? Did you open the laptop and check the fans , clean the dust out, make sure the board looked good,  no frayed or burned wires , no water damage, loose conductors and so on. Let‚Äôs just say it didn‚Äôt inspire a lot of confidence at this point.<br />  Now I tried to work with the seller as I bought a aftermarket extended warranty I always do or warranties when offered in house, however I  was not going to open a claim and burn my warranty on a MacBook Pro I‚Äôve had less than 5 days . I asked them ‚Äú Hey how about this , at least fix the ports and send it back and we are good , basically they said straight away  No, ‚Ä¶ ok, ‚Ä¶. next I said well how about taking some money off the top of the price , so I can get it fixed myself knowing very well even if they took $100 off , the repair was way more than that and I was willing to pay that money if they agreed as replacing a typE-C port is a expensive fix because the type c port would need replacement and sottering back on the main board. Nope. They weren‚Äôt interested l.<br />  Next,  they said I bought a product that was in ‚Äú acceptable condition‚Äù . I can‚Äôt lie , my jaw dropped , that wasn‚Äôt stated , and frankly I don‚Äôt buy items like that and take chances with high value items. This was my issue , while we spoke professional and cordial there was a problem , first not only do I document everything I do in business, again I would never buy anything other than a in ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù shape product. I even went back to the ad/posting and it does not say that via screenshots I took and the original order details and receipt anywhere . Now , many of  these stores will have those options ‚Äúused , acceptable, newish , excellent,‚Äù you get the idea, this said nothing of the sort, frustrating that they didn‚Äôt want to work with me and make it right as there was a accountability issue here , and if it was on me I would take it but it‚Äôs not , so why is Amazon and this seller passing the buck. That said ,  the bigger issue is that Amazon is putting their name on a product as it‚Äôs been refurbished by them and it‚Äôs not, basically giving their stamp of approval on products they have never seen or touched. That‚Äôs a problem.  If you read Amazon promise or the paperwork or the ad it says at the very least the laptop should be in working order all around , battery at 80% , which means a low cycle count on a Mac  , and so on, take the time to read the Amazon renewed/refurbished promise , so first tip unless it‚Äôs  truly in house from Amazon and delivered by Amazon don‚Äôt expect said product to be honored or that renewed promise to be even true for that matter and THAT is the lesson . Use the filters in the app & web , select only dealers from Amazon and delivery by Amazon as they will make it right, as to where a 3rd party seller can sell you something that was not checked properly maybe it slipped through the cracks which is still unacceptable for high priced items. They do not have to honor a thing , it‚Äôs a trial and error process at your expense, meaning having worked in repair shops years back sometimes they are very understaffed and  busy, or they have ‚Äútechs‚Äù in training or plain out just not qualified.<br />  Now , I am not bashing this seller but I was not happy with the grey area of accountability which was admitted by both the seller & Amazon. If Amazon is going to put there stamp on it , you may want to be the ones making sure what‚Äôs being sold actually works otherwise your name starts getting muddy, and to the seller you would‚Äôve been better off just fixing a laptop your going to have to fix anyway to resell it knowing it has 2 bad ports at the least and could‚Äôve kept a sale. Now we all lose. I considered doing  business again with the seller just so it‚Äôs said, only because our conversation wasn‚Äôt bad but wasn‚Äôt helpful , and how can I trust the next laptop you send will be great ,which  the last message did indeed say make sure to let them know when I make another order and they would make sure it was good to go but again, really ? Would it? And at what cost? How much more will that cost and how much more time will it take from my business.<br />  Finally , after some readjusting, I ended up finding a MacBook Pro a year newer (almost 2 years,  a late 2019) that had a faster cpu 2.6 6 core Intel up to 4.3ghz still 16 gb DDR4 a much better gpu set up  ( the dual Intel UHD graphics card built in with the PCle Radeon Pro 555x and double the SSD storage 512gb. and a 2 year warranty that covers anything for just  $100 more than what I spent here , Down side I had to get a silver and not a space gray but would  that really matter at the end of they day for you ? . So $800 and I have a 2 year old MBP that has better specs and actually backed by Amazon and there warranty THEY offer.<br />  The moral of this long review is to first realize this is going to be a crummy time trying to have a good experience even doing the tips I‚Äôm about to wrap up with, it‚Äôs the luck of the draw , if you don‚Äôt want to play this game just go to Apple and buy new, trust me, that‚Äôs the best advice if you don‚Äôt want this game.  ‚Ä¶I personally like the touchbar series Mac and they are still upgradable compared to some older models and newer models. So finally the tips , compare sellers , ask questions before you buy to the seller , read over the asked questions section , know your product and what the product is worth and maybe a 10-15% markup at most, in fairness depending on the way the seller gets their products they don‚Äôt make a lot of money on these sales, BUT  that should never affect you as a consumer. Never.<br />  Look for sellers that are 100% under Amazon‚Äôs umbrella which is getting hard but they are out there , use the filters when shopping and finally pay the money for the warranty, you are making a investment don‚Äôt cheap out on your purchase.<br />  These are the best tips I can give as my experience was NOT great with this seller and it‚Äôs a shame because this was a workable situation, it could‚Äôve been saved had they done what was right, while they were not rude , but it was very apparent they did not care very much as I sad , from the opening dialogue we had was basically you don‚Äôt  like it , return it ,then to the I bought a ‚Äú acceptable ‚Äú product, which was not stated anywhere, as I said I don‚Äôt buy those types of products,  there was only one buy option and that wasn‚Äôt  mentioned,  I pay attention and I know what I buy,which is still no excuse for the product to not work amd be beat up while having a Amazon renewed sticker on Int‚Ä¶.  I am a small businessman , I also know arguing with a seller will get you nowhere , they weren‚Äôt willing to make this mistake right or try to meet in the middle , and I tried.. SO, it cost me time and money and a client in that time lost I‚Äôm my business being I was a in a deadline and expected no issues as I don‚Äôt buy risky products, and they also lost a sale they could‚Äôve kept and honestly, a repeat customer that would have brought them a lot of business with my following that is loyal it just seemed silly to be being they will have to repair that Mac regardless and we both lost time. It was a mess of a situation that didn‚Äôt have to be .  My refund is being processed in the next day or so  and that would‚Äôve gotten done either way as the laptop truly showed up not functional and looking rough. I gave they seller the opportunity to fix it they didn‚Äôt and at least Amazon didn‚Äôt have to step in so I will give them that. This is a tricky  situation with the Amazon renewed/refurbished stamp going on these 3rd party stores, it‚Äôs becoming a issue. I have to say , although the seller Reuse were cordial, I would not recommend this seller based on the fact they are misleading in their selling tactics and ads/postings ,they knowingly sent out a product without being diagnosed properly and fully , they wasted my time and money and refused to work with me to get a functional laptop. Unfortunately this is a stay away for me folks , I have many reviews out there all over and folks know I shoot straight .

A lot to choose from, which is great for all of us. I prefer doing my work on a Mac, and Mac OS. It fits like a tailored glove, and once you‚Äôve experienced that; it‚Äôs hard to come back to windows no matter which laptop. And I‚Äôve tried probably close to virtually all of them. If in doubt, buy this Mac; give it a test drive. Return if you don‚Äôt like it.

"The machine looked good. I liked the darker gray. It was faster than my older MacBook Air. (E.g. 3-times faster on shut-down.)<br /><br />I was disappointed that battery life wasn't improved.<br />I was dismayed that they had an entirely different connection for the charger. They replaced the magnet connector, making it possible, once again, to trip on the cord and bring the computer smashing to the ground. I also missed the status light that, on the old connector, would tell you at a glance whether it was connected to power, if it was charging, and when the computer was charged. I had to buy an adaptor to use my old chargers with the new unit.<br />I missed the RS-232 connector. I had to buy an adaptor before I could use my external back-up drives.<br />Transferring data from my Time Machine was a pain. The MacOS on my old computer was newer than on the new one so nothing could happen until I updated the OS on the new computer. (Transferring content from the old computer to the new should be easier.

"I bought this new Macbook Pro 15&quot; with Touch Bar from Apple.com. I have been using it for a few days and I have only one word to say &quot;AMAZING&quot;. I am an avid Apple user and have a few Apple devices like iPad Pro 9.7&quot;, iPhone 4s, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s plus, iPhone 7 plus, iPhone SE, and now this to provide some context.<br /><br />Overview: This particular model which I have (Maxed-out except SSD), 16GB RAM, 2.9GHz quad-core Intel Core i7, Radeon Pro 460 with 4GB, 256GB SSD) is definitely a Pro machine. I would highly recommend this machine to people looking for an excellent replacement for their previous pro generation models with great screen.<br /><br />Design: This machine is typical Apple it is well designed with a thin and light form factor. It is a truly gorgeous looking machine. It is 3.3kgs according to the box and much less weight for a pro i7 and dedicated GPU machine like this. The chassis is very compact for the size of the machine overall.<br /><br />Display: I admit I am a screen noob and don't know much about the screen machanics and people say it's the same resolution like previous models  but this screen is quite gorgeous the color is great and more brighter and definitely welcome if you have iPad Pro 9.7 and iPhone 7 plus which also have this color gamut. The colors are rich. This thing is eye piercing bright. Much brighter then any other laptop I have ever used. Overall it is great having the extra real-estate of the larger screen when compared to the 13‚Äù Macbook.<br /><br />Keyboard: I love the new keyboard and the loud clicky sound it produces. I know this is a user specific thing and so try it out but give it a chance because in my experience it took me a few days to get used to. This is similar in that it has much less travel then the older MBP. The larger keys are also easier to make less mistakes on. There is something satisfying about the sound though.<br /><br />Touch Pad: Great but it's HUGE. I wish they would have made Apple pencil compatibility that would have been quite awesome. I think the touch bar  will be quite useful in the long run as more applications will be made in the coming months maybe I‚Äôll be proved wrong over time but the placement seems good once you use it.<br /><br />Speed: This machine is fast if you are looking at it compared to an Air or a 12‚Äù machine. The SSD screams and the package overall is excellent for the right consumer.<br /><br />Price: So the elephant in the room is price. This is about $500 north of obnoxious pricing. I think it is a fine machine and I love it personally but I had a feel of being gouged a bit by Apple at $3,000. When compared to the previous pro well that is a bit odd because that machine is really old when you look at it the screen alone is ancient and the touch bar so basically we are paying this much for the touchbar and you can get the same hardware in other brands but again Apple is Apple you can't compare Apple with any other brand in terms of creativity and customer service<br /><br />I do recommend this machine to the right consumer. Namely to a previous MacBook Pro user or anyone who was looking to buy a Dell XPS or any other premium machine from any other brand, a person looking for a great screen, battery life, faster SSD and something new and this will last 3-5 years, Go for this one you will not be disappointed at all.<br /><br />The only small gripe I have is that it doesn‚Äôt come in the range of colors like rose gold or even new colors to attract more customers. It is a small minor thing but oh well don't forget the extra dongles we need for everything we get Four Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports and can't even connect our iPhone 7 plus with this new machine but again people will get used to it as we got with the headphone jack not being there on the iPhone 7 and USB-C is the future that's why Apple is doing this.<br /><br />ATLEAST WE HAVE THE HEADPHONE JACK ON THIS MACHINE .! :P (y)<br /><br />Good Luck buying this machine and look at the pictures below to see how it looks :)",0.82,1020.03,0.18808329601433052,0.39339252520014767,iPhone
"I first bought the lowest-priced MacBook Air which has the lowest capacity SSD of all available. When it showed up at my house, I was surprised at how sluggish it was. I read some reviews, and realized that Apple didn't make it clear (at least to me) that the lowest-priced Air also has a slower, dual core processor. It makes sense in hindsight, but I digress. I returned that Air, and replaced it with the 500+GB SSD and quad core processor. Wow! The difference in performance is marked! Multitasking, turning on from sleep, everything is MUCH quicker and smoother than with the dual core processor. If you can afford the higher-priced model, I really recommend it!<br /><br />Overall, the MacBook Air is really a beautiful machine aesthetically. I the recycled aluminum exterior is slick and high-end. The onboard speaker won't ever be confused for an external sound system, but it is the best onboard speaker system I've heard. The Retina screen looks great; vibrant and detailed. I also love the large touch pad with the gestures.<br /><br />My favorite aspect of the laptop is the OS. Out of the box this runs Catalina. I haven't owned a Mac since the iBook G4, but I got back into it without much exploring required. I like how easily it works with my iPhone XR as well. Getting texts on the laptop, or pushing a webpage on my iPhone to my Air is seamless and easy. Things just work. I needed to download updated drivers so that I could print wirelessly to my Canon laser printer, but that took five minutes. I also downloaded and installed Chrome for Mac, which I use for a few things, but Safari works very well for the sites I visit. I did have to buy a converter cable that switched from the onboard USB-C to a regular USB cable for a few attachments I have, but that was pretty cheap (especially for an Apple product). I wish the Air had one more USB-C port.<br /><br />Some people hate the onboard camera. At first I was disappointed with it too. With all of this COVID business, I use my laptop to play D&D online with friends via Roll20. We use cameras to interact with each other, and although I found the onboard camera to be slightly grainy, it is very fluid. One of my friends commented that everyone else's video feed stuttered as they moved, but mine looked like he was watching TV. So, although it could be better, it is NOT horrible for my purposes. For the price we pay, Apple could beef up the camera, but it is what it is.",0.9400000000000001,1199.99,0.16442743764172335,0.3912546544933764,iPhone

"If you've been waiting for Apple to wake up and address the concerns raised by the Apple community -- your wait is now over. This is the MacBook Pro we've all been wanting for years. This review is for the higher end model, stock.<br /><br />The good.<br /><br />- Keyboard. It's fantastic. The key travel has been extended to 1mm, which is about half of the original keyboard found on the 2015 and prior model years. It feels just as good to type on because apple improved the tactile feedback. The keys sort of spring back. The keyboard is quiet and very comfortable to type on. The keys are slightly smaller but do not make typing on them any more difficult. The directional arrows are now properly setup and the physical Esc key is back, making it a breeze to flip through open applications.<br /><br />- Screen. The difference in size is subtle but noticeable. It's technically even more dense, but just barely. You won't notice much difference from recent MacBook Pros but true to Apple, the display is absolutely gorgeous. The 0.6 inch difference in size retains the same logical resolution, so everything should look just slightly bigger which I welcome.<br /><br />- Processor. The base model has the same chipset as the 2019 15.4"" model. The performance, however, is about 10% better due to significantly improved airflow and larger heatsinks. The issue of heat related throttling has been largely addressed. On the upper model, the machine now comes with 8 cores and serious performance bump. There is literally nothing you can throw at this MacBook that it won't handle with breeze.<br /><br />- Graphics. The traditional setup is still here. You have the onboard Intel chipset, which operates when the demand for visual performance is low. You also have a discrete AMD chip which delivers significant improvement over the previous generation. In fact, the base model delivers performance in excess of the upper spec Vega chipset from last year. The leap is extraordinary. As before, the system will automatically choose which graphics card to use depending on demand.<br /><br />- Sound. In one world, amazing. Imagine Apple took a HomePod and flattened it to fit it in the housing of the MacBook Pro. That is essentially the experience. Bass is pronounced and crisp and treble is sharp. The sound is rich and room-filling. There are six speakers instead of two in the last generation.<br /><br />-Microphone. Major improvements with three mics instead of one in the previous generation. I use the MacBook to make calls using an iPhone and the sound on the other end is clear and free from background noice. I've been told it sounds a lot better than before, but that is of course subjective. On paper, you're getting better noise reduction and improved sound fidelity.<br /><br />- Touch Bar. Controversial in the past, I think it may now be the ""happy medium"" between physical keys and the useful Touch Bar which adapts to the content on the screen. The Esc key is back and on the right hand side you'll find Touch ID and power button.<br /><br />- SSD. You'll love the fact that now base starting size of the SSD has been doubled on both the entry model and the upper model with 512GB and 1TB respectively.<br /><br />- Gaming. This has to be mentioned. The graphics card offers incredible leap in performance. Modern games that would get 14-16FPS on high setting now perform at 35-40FPS with ease. Same settings. Same games. Huge improvement. It's now possible to play AAA games on the MacBook Pro with reasonable performance and high visual settings.<br /><br />- Productivity. This machine is a beast. I use the full Affinity suite and do some limited video editing. In addition, I have multiple productivity programs open, over a dozen Safari tabs, two email clients, and dozens of other apps, such as CRM, task managers, notes, etc. Everything runs smoothly.<br /><br />- Value. Yes, value. This expensive laptop brings the best value in the lineup of the 15.""4 (now 16"") offering to date. If you carefully look at the costs of truly compatible Windows offerings, you'll find the MacBook Pro to be competitively priced.<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />- Weight. The machine is slightly heavier but I welcome the added bulky. Finally Apple went with functionality over its obsession with thiner and lighter hardware, giving us a machine with proper thermal management, proper keyboard and more. But if you plan on taking it with you places, you'll feel the extra bulk.<br /><br />- BTO Updates. The cost of BTO options is still quite high, with the noted exception of the 8GB option on the GPU. You're still paying a significant premium for each incremental upgrade over the base model.<br /><br />To sum up -- This is the best MacBook Pro in many years. It's a well-rounded, powerful machine that brings about incredible performance and value. I would highly recommend it to any Pro.<br /><br />If you're upgrading from the 13"" model and wonder how much more real estate you can expect, see attached side-by-side comparison photo.<br /><br />Update 3/15/20 -- Absolutely a beast of a machine. I love it. It has been pretty much perfect and its performance continues to surprise me. I have the top-speced model and it smokes pretty much everything I've used to date. In fact, it will perform on par with the new Mac Pro base configuration. Don't believe me? Google it. This is by far the best MacBook Pro to date and an amazing value. Well worth the price of admission if you need it.",0.9400000000000001,1318.24,0.15478464894480523,0.36914524844901087,iPhone

I read a ton of reviews, watched a bunch off Youtube vids on it, and went ahead and bought it on Amazon.<br /><br />The Pros;<br />Nice look. Sharp. Nice keys. Easy to navigate. I'm not a ""tech"" person so I can't talk about the Flux Capacitor and the internal combustion engine etc. It works well so far....<br /><br /> I need my computer to run my business (and personal). I spent hours and hours per day on it. It's a huge party of my life and a huge part of running my company is using Zoom and having fast Internet...so on to the Cons.<br />The Cons;<br />2 huge cons.... the camera is SOOOOOO grainy and looks like it was fitted on a 1999 computer. It's terrible. I'm shocked Apple would green light something so terrible. My 2014 Macbook camera ROCKS! This one does not. It is way way below the standard Apple has set, in my eyes.<br />The second thing is the ports on the side are all USB C ports now. So, knowing this in advance, I bought an Anker adapter so I could plug in cables such a microphone...USB....SD card....HDMI and ETHERNET into it.<br />But......within the computer itself, the computer is not reading/accepting the ETHERNET cable. I desperately need to be ETHERNETTED to my router (not WiFi) to run my company. The Ethernet cable works on my 2014 just fine. I youtubed and googled to find a way around this and could not find any solutions. VERY, VERY disappointing.<br /><br />The two MAIN things I need to run my business.....it fails...BIGTIME.<br /><br />I am still on team apple....I will still buy your products, but I am bitterly disappointed in this MacBook. :(<br /><br />- Garry",0.9400000000000001,1199.99,-0.0400119420809076,0.28903496463206085,iPhone

"These AirPods are amazing.  The noise cancellation and its inverse ambient noise allowance are incredible.  I use them riding my bike to be able to still hear movement around me, and I use them in my shop to drown out loud noises.  Both functions work extremely well.<br /><br />But.. 2 weeks in and now my left AirPod no longer holds charge.  I can put it in the case and see it get up to about 35%, but as soon as it comes out it drops to 7% and then dies.  The AirPods haven't been dropped or put through the washer or anything: it just appears that one has gone defective.  That being said, it is also very hard to monitor battery life on them.  You have to have the case with you, and even then it doesn't always show you battery status.  You may have to enable it as an extra screen on your iPhone, and then sometimes it won't tell you the charge of each individual AirPod.

"This is my second day with airpods pro. So far, I‚Äôve mixed impressions. On one hand, beautifully made, a pleasure to hold in your hand or in ear (comfortable enough, especially in comparison to other earbuds I have) and the sound is awesome, including no excessive bass. And, of course, the noise control feature is great. It isn‚Äôt a match to over-the-ear headphones (and it probably can‚Äôt be), but it is effective enough to make it very usable outside (no need for blasting sound levels and they are good for  all types of music, not just rap and the like).<br /><br />But, on the other hand, which is somewhat depressing given the price and the brand, they are shockingly user unfriendly (what happened to Steve's Apple!?!).<br />First, the connect button function? What‚Äôs up with that? All others brands I used do it automatically by taking the buds out, and that‚Äôs it.<br />Second, the button itself is a relic: it is hard to see/feel, let alone to press. Are we back into the stone age of doing by hand? Seriously. Third, there are no useful battery status indicators, especially the status of the battery (how much juice is left) or whether it is fully charged. One needs to bother with an iPhone to look that up. How convenient is that?<br /><br />Don‚Äôt know the battery life yet.<br /><br />May 6 update.<br />Cons:<br />Battery life is only 4 / 4.5 hours (with ANC on), which is really limited, especially given the price.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Bluetooth range is excellent, if not out of this world.

"AirPods Pro review<br /><br />There are two types of noise-canceling I am talking about here. One type is canceling the noise so that my students cannot hear the background noise. This is the type of noise-canceling that I am interested in. Another type is canceling the noise so that I cannot hear the background noise. This is the type of noise-canceling that is good for listening to music.<br /><br />I teach community college on Zoom, and my students can hear the construction noise in my background because a new building is under construction next to my place. For my students, I bought Plantronic Voyager 5200 and AirPods Pro. My students can still hear some loud noise with AirPods Pro, but they can hear nothing except my voice from Plantronic. I bought several (MpowX3 with ANC, iTeknic, Enacfire E60 with ANC, Boltune BT-BH023 with ANC, Boltune BT-BH024 with CVC 8.0, TOZO NC9 with ANC) and recorded in my bathroom with the ventilation fan on, and in a quiet room with my cell phone music in the background.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Comfortable to wear for many hours<br />2. The second-best noise cancellation for listening to music (the best one for this type of noise cancellation is Boltune BT-BH023 with ANC)<br />3. The second-best cancellation of the background construction noise according to my students<br />4. The second-best cancellation of the noise from my bathroom ventilation fan according to my recording<br />5. Most stable connection with no interruption with my MacBook Pro and iPhone<br />6. No electronic noise when switching ANC on and off<br />7. The least distortion of my voice from the recording in the bathroom with a ventilation fan and ANC on<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Cannot be found by ‚ÄúFind My‚Äù from my MacBook Pro and does not show up in ‚ÄúMy Support‚Äù or ‚ÄúApple ID‚Äù devices. After I paired with my iPhone, AirPods Pro showed up in ‚ÄúFind My‚Äù from both my MacBook Pro and iPhone.<br />2. Short battery life: a pair of fully charged earbuds can last 3.5 hours of talk time.<br />3. Relatively weak bass: these earbuds have the weakest bass in comparison to other earbuds under $60.<br />4. Can still hear the background construction noise and my cell phone music in the background with ANC on<br />5. The least distortion of my voice from the recording in the bathroom with ventilation fan and ANC on.<br />6. Expensive<br /><br />Overall:<br />I am happy and satisfied with this purchase. For teaching on Zoom, I use Plantronic Voyager 5200. For listening to music, I use AirPods Pro. I rank AirPods Pro as the best TWS earbuds. The second-best are Boltune BT-BH023 with ANC and MpowX3 with ANC. Plantronic Voyager 5200 is the best for talking, i.e., canceling noise for the audience. I am looking forward to the 3D surround sound of AirPods Pro in the future update.",0.96,,0.1956293706293707,,iPhone
"When I went to pick up my iPad the opening week this past year, I knew, like most of my other products I bought from Apple (iPhone, iPod Touch, MacBook etc..) that I am going to want to get a case.<br /><br />And of course, being a new product, a lot of companies weren't out on the market with their personal take on a case, so Apple had their own brand made, which is the case in question.<br /><br />I liked it at first, it gave it a professional look, but similar to what other people stated, it gave a weird feel to the iPad. You had to hold a certain way to interact with the iPad and showing other people. It only tilts so much, that you're better off sitting upright using the tilt function, because laying down, or any other position, it was pointless.<br /><br />Then, that professional look I was talking about? That all went out the window, because after a few weeks of house, the way the material is on the case itself, it picked up finger prints, dust, and all other kinds of stuff. And it's not very easy to clean off either.<br /><br />Pretty much in short, for us early adopters, this was our only option for a while, but now, with Xmas under way, and the iPad having a few months under it's belt, you're better off getting something else. There's tons of nice portfolio's, packs, slip cases, skins etc for it, that you'll be alright finding a good fit for you",0.86,,0.11781543109668109,,iPhone

"First the good: great sound and volume, perfect Bluetooth connectivity to iPhone and iPod, transparent and noise cancellation functions very impressive and useful. The less good: The comfort was excellent but these fell out of my ears, so I needed to purchase foam type ear pieces. This was an 80% improvement, with only occasional falling out of ears.  I listen to TV and audio books for up to 9 hrs a day, so these get a lot of use. I try and charge them whenever they are not in my ears, and even sometimes listen with one, while charging the other, but I generally run out of charge almost every day. To listen to TV I use a Bluetooth adapter to the TV's optical audio port. The works very well except I needed to get an adapter that also provides volume control as there is no iPod-air integral volume control and the iPhone volume control has not be extended to function if the iPod-airs are paired with a non apple Bluetooth adapter (although the battery status monitoring seems to be). Also if I go a short distance from this (TV) Bluetooth adapter I loose the audio signal, even though I am still paired to this adapter (adapter has a light showing it is paired and a sonic signal when pairing is lost or regained). To get the audio back I need to place one of the iPod-airs back in the charging case for a second. Also this is a less than optimal solution as to change the volume for different programs on the TV I need to get up and make the change at the adapter. For some TV programs the audio is not quite loud enough, which is not a limitation of the iPod-airs, just of the volume control, as they have plenty of volume and the audio signal is clear.",0.96,,0.24864398422090728,,iPhone

"For several years I used various brands of PDAs.  The Apple IPod Touch has perfected this device. It is excellent for music, but it has become a valuable tool for keeping up with things and finding out where things are. It takes good snap shots and is a library in your pocket. I also have an iPad. But the portability of the iPod touch lets you have your device in tow when you don't have a lot of room to carry stuff.  If you want an iPhone and are waiting for a contract to expire...this is a great tool. I carry it around with a small portable hot spot. My android phone exhausts it's battery in a very short time if used for anything other than calling.

"The single star is my response to how this purchase made me feel.<br />Cons:<br />What‚Äôs in the box? Just the iPad, power adapter and a cord that‚Äôs incompatible with everything I own and every available plug in various airplanes, buses, coffee shops and my home. Apple has yet again forced our hand in changing a plug because they think it‚Äôs best. In turn I had to purchase separately a USBc to USB and a USBc to Lightening. An extra cost and wait time of adapters that would have cost Apple nothing to include. I also had to purchase a cover and opted for a third-party keyboard version, not Apple‚Äôs $180 one. Again, the very least that could have included was a simple covering case as this model seems so fragile. To address the ‚ÄúPro‚Äù of this, nothing about the device is Pro, additional plug types, card reader, something, but this uses the same iOS as any of the non-pro models, so not getting it?  I have the previous 1st edition of the iPad, that when I first purchased it, I took it everywhere with me until the romance was over and iPhone started to have just as much options. The Apple Pencil, which also does not come with this, and most certainly should have, was an extra $130 purchase. As opposed to the ads where they show it sticking magnetically to the sides, locked on to charge and be available to you, does not. There‚Äôs a sweet spot you have to align the pencil with and falls off with the slightest bump or swift movement, so I‚Äôm sure I will be loosing that anytime now. So, sounds like I should just return this and go for the similar in function and far cheaper cost of a Samsung or the like, right?<br />Pros: It‚Äôs super fast. It glides and zooms quicker than anything else I own.  Using the pencil feels the most natural to any other tablet set up I‚Äôve tried. Once the new cord arrives, so I can actually transfer all my music, photos, and books, I know it will be my new best buddy.<br /><br />I purchased this because I an upgrade option came up on my iPhone. I have the 7s Max, which works completely fine and I use less and less for anything more than texts and emails. But for less than the price of the newest iPhone, I could get this iPad ‚Äúpro‚Äù, which I could actually get a ton more use out of. Let‚Äôs see. But as far as Apple as a company, they make me feel like an adopted sibling that has to work a little harder for anything the rest of the family is just given.

"First, I am a long time user of Mac products but this is my first Apple Watch so I cannot offer comparisons to previous versions. As I am both active and getting older, the emergency fall function seemed practical. It is but, in terms of health monitoring, it offers much more. From ECGs and other heart parameters  to sleep records, fitness records and more, it gives one a definitive record of activity/inactivity, momentum vs inertia. As the AW mirrors much of your iPhone, there is too much to describe.<br /><br />41 vs 45? That is a matter of personal choice. Readability is a frequent question. While I am male, 6 foot and 175lbs, I chose the 41 because it was available and I prefer a smaller piece on my wrist. The screen display is very customizable, it works for me (I attached a photo for reference). The standard sports band is fine but there are many alternatives available.<br /><br />The cellular function? It seemed essential in case I was out of range of my iPhone. After fielding many calls using the AW only, the quality is indistinguishable from my iPhone. Next step is figuring out wireless earbuds üòé. Not to mention little things like haptic alarms, subtle but effective. Battery life could be better but, with high use, it lasts a full day. I charge it when I awaken in the morning and haven‚Äôt dipped below 20%.<br /><br />Bottom line? I can‚Äôt believe I spent this much on this watch but I‚Äôm glad I did. Yes, there are alternative, less pricey choices, I looked at many. I am pleased with the AW7.",0.96,,0.17110360360360358,,iPhone
"I previously owned a Late 2011 13&#34; MacBook Pro and an 11&#34; MacBook Air Early 2016. The Macbook Pro was my main machine and the MacBook Air was something that I got at a great price. I thought that I would favor the MacBook Pro, but as I used the MacBook Air I began to appreciate the design philosophy of it more and more. The MacBook Pro seemed to be a cement brick next to the Air, and so I began to favor the Air because I find myself moving around with my laptops more and more. Portability has become very important to me. I loved the Air, and surprisingly enough I even liked the smaller form factor. It was easy to move, about the same size as my iPad Air 2 with a ClamCase, and it was a full computer.<br /><br />I fantasized about getting the 13&#34; Air only because of the inferior display on the 11&#34;. I had to get a custom color profile to be able to use it properly. Still, after that it became my go to device as it was small and fast. In the end, I sold it because it only came with 128GB of storage, which is paltry considering the 13&#34; MacBook Pro had 750GB of space and I was almost full on that.<br /><br />When the MacBook originally came out I was one of the detractors of it. That was because the idea behind it was a bit harder to ascertain right away. My thoughts, especially considering the specs, were that the MacBook Air was much better of a value. The new MacBook is a bit of a niche device. It won't be apparent why you may want to try it right away. I wanted to get a 15&#34; MacBook Pro with a Retina display, but the price of the one that I wanted was a bit high, given the fact that that computer is way more machine than I need to have for the price.<br /><br />While I wanted a new computer the MacBook Pro I had was still fine; I mainly wanted newer features like the Bluetooth 4.0, the ability to do handoff with apps, the retina display, and so forth. When I purchased this MacBook, it was the new updated model (second version). I would not have wanted the first one, but the upgrades made to the 2016 version made it far more attractive. It comes with 512GB of flash storage, which is not as much as the 1TB I wanted but far less expensive. Also, it is more of a standard size. I became a fan of flash storage when I had the MacBook Air, and I don't want to use any computer that does not have Flash storage now!<br /><br />This MacBook is the gold version, which I got to match my gold iPhone 6 Plus and my gold iPad Air 2. Every version looks good, and the newest color is the rose gold one. I also got the version with the m5 dual core processor for more power. The MacBook comes with 8GB of memory standard, and that is more than enough with the flash storage. One negative with this laptop and pretty much all of Apple's current and future laptops is that they are moving towards soldering the RAM and the storage to the logic board so that they are no longer user-upgradeable. That means that you must buy what you want as far as those things go as you cannot upgrade them later.<br /><br />The MacBook has a 12&#34; Retina Display, which is gorgeous. The neat thing is that the MacBook and the 11&#34; MacBook Air have the same size chassis. The MacBook is able to get a 12&#34; display onto the same chassis as the 11&#34; by reducing the size of the bezel. I like the size of the 11' MacBook Air so that is a plus for me. In terms of size, the 12&#34; MacBook puts the Air to shame. I did not think any computer could be lighter than the Air, but boy was I wrong. The Air is like a brick compared to the size of the MacBook. I can easily lift it and carry it with one hand only. It is feather light but still very sturdy.<br /><br />The keyboard uses the new butterfly mechanism which does fatigue your fingers when you first start using it, but as you get used to the way it works it becomes very easy to use. The main thing is that the keys require minimal effort to push, so you need to learn to press them very lightly. The keys are full-sized and backlit. The speakers on the new MacBook are surprisingly good. I am always nervous when I see a speaker grille below the monitor as most are not good, but the speakers are clear and loud.<br /><br />The other controversy about the MacBook is the single USB-C port. Yes, they could have tried to put another on, but given the way they had to engineer the laptop to get it to be so small and light, concessions had to be made somewhere and the port was it. The USB-C port is the only port to connect any peripherals (other than a 3.5 mm headphone jack), so you have to use it to charge the laptop as well as to connect anything like a USB cable or anything like that. You can easily get an adapter that allows you to connect more than one thing at a time, but they are somewhat pricey. As the USB-C technology (which is good and I like it very much) becomes more common, the cost should go down. At first I was very annoyed by this but as time went on, I have adjusted to the single port. I find that now I am able to understand that this laptop is more for those who want maximum portability, and for those who want a device to use mainly with wireless/bluetooth accessories and cloud services.<br /><br />The force touch trackpad seems a bit gimmicky to me. I almost never use the deep press option, but I can see how it would be useful. Perhaps there will be more configuration options that make it more useful, but for now I am using the trackpad as I always have. The MacBook does have a pretty low resolution camera. I don't film videos on my MacBook or use it for anything other than basic Facetime and such, so that does not bother me. There are some people who are heartbroken that the camera is not full HD, but the camera is not heavy duty due to the way the MacBook is designed. To make it the thinnest and lightest, that was one concession that had to be made.<br /><br />There are many concerns about the performance of the laptop. The first version had a few performance issues that made it a hard recommendation, but the 2016 upgrade has minimized those issues. I have run Parallels (2 Windows VMs) at the same time I was streaming YouTube videos and I was able to jump between them with little issues. I have had it freeze on me twice, and there have been some hangs, but nothing that has not happened to me on either the MacBook Pro or Air. I think that there has been a lot of misinformation about what this laptop can handle. Make no mistake, this is not a workstation. Yes, you can use some powerful programs on it, but it is not meant to be a heavy duty machine. The average user will have no problems with it in terms of performance. I have heard of people using auto CAD software on it without any issue. I also ran Final Cut and Logic Pro on it, and while it does take a bit of time to process and render with those programs it is more than capable of running them without a catastrophe. The processor was chosen because the MacBook is a fanless laptop, so they had to pick a processor that would not overheat without active cooling. It means that the processor is less powerful, but it still works.<br /><br />In short, the design philosophy behind the MacBook is that it is mean to be the most powerful and lightest ultrabook that it can be. It had to balance power, performance, price, storage, and features to get there, and so the result is a machine that does not seem to follow the obvious design options as any other laptop available. If you can open your mind, however, this laptop can be exactly what you need. More and more people have began loving it, and even I myself have warmed up to it. I used to wonder if I should go back to my MacBook Pro, but now I am more than satisfied with this one. I had the chance to get a MacBook Pro 15&#34; and decided against it as now that I am familiar with this laptop, given the price, features, and how I use it, the MacBook Pro would have been unnecessary. Many tech reviewers now state this is their daily driver for anything that is not hardware intensive, and I am right with them. I love the MacBook and I am glad that I gave it a try. If you can allow yourself to give it a try I would recommend it because you may find that it is a better option for you than you think.",0.86,,0.17918086543086542,,iPhone

"I didn't buy this product from Amazon but i am writing this review let my fellow buyers know the facts about this device.<br /><br />When Beats Launched this product, it looks so promising and impressed me to pre register myself to buy when they are available.<br />First didn't get any email notification when the product was available. I came to know from my friend after he started using it. This is big time recklessness from Beats about it's potential customers.<br /><br />I ordered this product on Beats website to save the taxes, i got my product little late but no complaints about the delivery process, weekend came in between.<br /><br />I received the product and the packaging is OK OK. I opened it and i had to charge it fully before i started pairing it with my iPhone 5S.<br /><br />The full charging was quick and within couple of hrs i can able to start it, pair it and started listening to the music. everything is going well, i am very happy and started taking them with me for work outs. it was working fine. battery life also seems good.<br /><br />After 2 -3 days of using this product and started putting together my experience to write my review on this product, that's where the problem has started.<br /><br />Issues:<br />1) It doesn't sync well with Apple products (I was using iPhone 5S and iPad 3). When you play the music it takes little time to start on the headset. also when i accept the call with headset's accept button there is gap in connecting with phone and hearing the outside voice. This is completely a surprise me. when i used it with android phone, it seems working fine but i didn't spend much time with that device (samsung).<br /><br />2) The sound quality for music is not so great. I the max sound is not so impressive and noise cancellation is also not perfect.<br /><br />I spoke to my other friend and explained about my observations, and replied me that i have already complained about it to Beats and they said they cant do anything except refund. that guy was already returned the product.<br /><br />Meanwhile Beats merged with Apple and moved their sales to iTunes. I had to contact to Apple. I contacted them and i got positive response from them as usual. they called me 3-4 times and asked several repeated questions and confirmed that they know the problem and they don't have any solution. they also offered me refund option.<br /><br />At the end i had to give up (return) this product.<br /><br />Conclusion: They made a great product but forgot to integrate it well. And this price tag $200 it is not worth facing those problems. I am hoping they (Apple) will fix these issues in their iOS 8. until then i recommend you to wait. this is the worst experience i have ever faced with Apple so far.",0.82,,0.22860422405876954,,iPhone
"Time will tell whether these will fall apart like other people have described in other reviews. That said, I wanted to provide my insight into these as a product with an MSRP of about $200 and a &#34;street price&#34; of $100-$130.<br /><br />Let's start with the packaging. These are packaged very nicely, meant to showcase the item in the box itself. The box opens by pulling a thin strip of plastic at the bottom, like you would on an overnight shipping envelope. The window in the front opens up, and you can pull the headphones out. One of the rubber detachable earbuds came off in removing the earphones from the (what appeared to be recycled) cardboard. I had to rip apart the cardboard on the charge cable and tip case in order to extract them.<br /><br />Next, the feel in your hands. Man, these feel cheap to me. The cord, which has much in common with the appearance of fettuccine pasta, feels a bit flimsy. The plastic body of the earphones is very lightweight. The rubber ear hook is a bit flexible, but does *not* rotate or adjust otherwise.<br /><br />How about operation? Putting these on is pretty easy compared to some other hook-type earphones I've used. I still don't like that the ear hooks don't rotate at all, but that fact may actually be the reason they're easy to put on and take off. The power button is operated (when wearing them) by squeezing the left earphone with your index finger on top and your thumb on the bottom -- the button is on the top. You get a status chime when you turn them on, and they paired on the second (not first!) attempt to my iPhone 6S. Volume can be controlled directly from the iPhone or with the in-line buttons.<br /><br />Sound quality. Yes, the crux of many headphones. I've reviewed headphones on here from $30 to $300, and honestly, there isn't really a linear correlation between price and sound quality. These are not IEM earphones, so you do not get a full seal in your ears like you would with a Sure or Etymotic pair of IEM earphones. That said, the sound quality is better than I would have expected for something that does not seal. The bass is not nearly as impressive as I would have expected, but it does improve as you increase the volume to levels approaching what you could consider dangerous. If you press the earphones more toward your skull, you can definitely hear an improvement in bass, which is why I think these really don't perform so great. Sound clarity is quite good in the mid and high ends. Maybe a tad fatiguing as you get up high, but it's not offensive. I listened to live rock tracks, some Americana, bluegrass, and some modern rock. All sounded decently good. The sound quality is one notch better than my $35 Koss Portapro over-the-ear headphones, but not in the bass department.<br /><br />A brief note on comfort: After a couple hours, these have not hurt my ears like other earphones or headphones do. You may want to experiment with tip sizes to make sure you're getting optimal fit, since everyone's ears are different.The little cinch at the bottom works well to keep the cable from flying everywhere. I'll take these on a run and report back on whether they stayed in place.<br /><br />Let's move on to battery life. Out of the box, they registered a roughly 60% battery charge on my iPhone. After one hour, the indication dropped to 50%. Not bad considering an average listening volume of 40%.<br /><br />Finally, the carrying case, and a note to Beats: If you are going to provide accessories like a charging cable and additional tips, it would make sense for you to have an internal pouch for these accessories inside of your case. The case itself seems to be solidly-constructed, but lacks this pouch and is a bit clumsy to use with the way the zipper occasionally flips inside out.<br /><br />Overall, I do not think these should be priced a penny over $75. The only reason I own them is because of a recent Apple promotion that included a free pair with purchase of iPad or Mac. They were kind enough to retroactively apply this promotion to a purchase I made at the end of April, so I got a pretty neat set of headphones to review. Make no mistake, I would never pay the ~$130 current asking price for them, much less the $199.95 the box is labeled for.",0.82,,0.15931324110671938,,iPhone

My only problem was this was sold as very good condition, but should have been listed as acceptable.  The screen has tiny scratches all over it and the back is scratched up very bad also.

"I purchased five to send sound to different stereos around the house and they've worked great for years now. I love using my iPhone and the free Remote app to control the music during a party. If the song's too loud no matter what room I'm in I can subtly turn it down (or vs versa) as well as choose a play list, start and stop, and advance to the next song all without going to the Mac in another room that's streaming the music. I could just use the iPhone itself to stream from but my music library is huge. The Airport Express units have worked well year after year with zero issues. The optical or analogue audio out is great depending on the stereo system I'm feeding sound to. A good unit for audio streaming although I know it does so much more than what I use them for! I do on occasion take one with me when traveling so that if a hotel doesn't have Wi-Fi I can plug it into their ethernet connection and have my own wireless signal. It's the smallest way I've found to make that happen taking up less space in a suitcase. Zero technical issues for years and multiple units where they're plugged in 24/7 for about five years now and just keep working day after day.

"I'll write this review from the standpoint that I really like high-quality audio equipment.<br /><br />For those audiophiles out there: the DAC in this isn't great and it can't drive your 250 ohm headphones. Nope.<br /><br />For normal people.<br /><br />The sound that comes out of this is a bit worse than on my iPhone 5S and is much worse than any high-end audio equipment mumbo jump that I own. It has a hard time powering headphones with high-impedance levels (Beyerdynamic DT770 250 Ohms) but earbuds should be no problem. I recommend avoiding the use of the Apple Earpods however as they are open and that leaks in a lot of noise when you wear them in public.<br /><br />I have the 16GB Green version of this device and have had it for nearly two years. It's got a couple dings but works well otherwise. Screen is responsive and the software looks like it did when I bought it, even after all updates (good). It's dead simple to use. I use mine strictly for music on the go and it works well for that. However I still suggest using your phone if possible. The price for what's really just a thin MP3 player is just not justified by anything that the Nano brings to the table.<br /><br />It gets 4 stars from me as it's lasted me two years and fits in any pocket. The sound it produces through my various earbuds is good enough. It's easy to use.

"If I had it to do over again I would not buy this watch.  Updating it is a nightmare.  The watch is currently on it's third hour of trying to install one simple update.  The watch must be left on the charger and it needs to be connected to my iphone via the bluetooth which renders the phone pretty much useless until the update is actually installed.

"For background, I am a recreational music producer and have typically used studio monitor setups ranging in price from $400 to over $1000. I have also owned a variety of Bose products including the QC15 noise cancelling headphones and multiple generations of SoundSport earbuds. I listen to at least 2 hrs of music a day. The listening experience on these earbuds vastly exceeds the Bose products I have owned and also rivals my professional grade KRK studio monitors. I will break down my review into a few categories:<br /><br />SIGNAL TO NOISE RATIO<br />The signal to noise ratio of these earbuds is truly exceptional. I have never heard any headphone or studio monitor with anywhere near as good of a signal to noise ratio. I am hearing details in music that didn't even come through clearly on my KRK studio monitors.<br /><br />NOISE CANCELLING<br />The noise cancelling is very good. Better than my Bose QC15s (headphones!) which were the industry standard years ago (granted, I haven't tried recent leaders like the Surface or Bose QC35s because I don't own them). For earbuds, I am impressed at how well they can block out sound.<br /><br />FIT and SEAL<br />I have average size ears so I chose the standard ""medium"" ear tips. My right earphone stays planted, but my left earphone slowly slips out over time. I believe this is due to the shape of my ear. They're not the most comfortable earbuds I have used because they have to press against your ear to make a good seal. After about an hour of listening I'm ready to take them out of my ears for a bit.<br /><br />FREQUENCY RESPONSE<br />The AirPods Pro have a pretty good frequency response. Mids are very clear and highs are sharp but are not piercing which is not easy to do. Bass is surprisingly a little heavy.. And I have a 1500W subwoofer in my car and a 8"" KRK sub connected to my studio monitors. So I'm a bit surprised at how much bass Apple decided to put in these. It's not at the point that it's distracting but I would say it's a little more low end than would be present in monitor grade equipment. For reference I listen to Hip Hop and Electronic music that tends to place a lot in the low end.<br /><br />TRANSPARENCY MODE<br />The transparency mode uses the microphones to amplify ambient sounds if you want to be more connected with the world around you such as when in an office where you might be approached. It definitely works. It sounds a bit artificial and not quite like real life but it surely helps hear what is happening around you. I would say this is not the setting to use for the best listening experience. Noise cancelling mode really helps engulf you in the music and is my preferred listening mode.<br /><br />CONVENIENCE:<br />Pairing to Apple devices is a breeze. I have a Mac, iPad, and iPhone and it is very quick to switch between them when I need. I have not tested connectivity on other devices, but it should work just fine as a normal bluetooth device for other equipment.<br /><br />OTHER<br />For some reason I thought these came with an app that would allow EQ modifications but they do not. Luckily the standard tuning is pretty balanced but like I said the low end is a bit inflated.<br /><br />Overall, these earbuds exceeded my expectation for the price point and are worth every penny. I am very happy with these!",0.96,,0.16207910486599011,,iPhone

"I deliver food for work and bought these so I don‚Äôt need to free a hand to call someone.

I will be using both in Transparency Mode so I can hear navigation, texts, etc. more loudly. The silicone tips did not work well for me. I purchased some memory foam tips that work great.<br /><br />The size and weight of the Airpods is great. They‚Äôre nothing like the original Bluetooth earpieces from the early 2000s. The battery life is not so great but considering Transparency Mode is actually the outside speakers listening to sounds and playing them through the inner speakers, I can understand that the batteries are constantly being worked.<br /><br />Overall, I‚Äôm very satisfied with my purchase and happy I stuck with the option that is directly compatible with my iPhone.",0.96,,0.2523148148148148,,iPhone
"I bought the first generation AirPods when they first came out. I didn‚Äôt mind the style despite all the jokes in social media (ear tampons?) and I loved them except for the fact that they‚Äôd constantly fall out of my ears. I know I wasn‚Äôt the only one with this problem but I‚Äôve always had trouble finding in-ear buds to stay in my smaller than average ears. The AirPods Pro fix all of that. I tried the medium size ear tips that were already equipped, and the AirPods were popping out of my ears after a few minutes. I put the small ear tips on and they haven‚Äôt popped out a single time. I even purchased a cellular plan for my Apple Watch again so I can take walks without having to carry my iPhone and still be able to enjoy music and answer calls, etc. I hadn‚Äôt had a use for it until the AirPods Pro.<br /><br />They have a lot of features that I really love, too. The noise canceling is top notch. Transparency is a little weird to me though. To me, its the equivalent to putting a glass against a door and putting your ear up to the glass to listen to people on the other side. It just sounds weird. But, I can definitely hear the people around me so I guess it‚Äôs doing it‚Äôs job. I much prefer the tactile feel of the stem button to the tapping on the old AirPods. Tapping just made them pop out sooner, usually as I was tapping them, so I never used those controls. The AirPods Pro stay secure in my ears even when pressing the button. I love that I can use the button on either side, too.<br /><br />My love for Siri has blossomed with these, too. I was never a fan of Siri but after wearing these for a week, I think she‚Äôs great. She definitely gets a bad rap. She got my requests every time, quickly and accurately. She never missed a ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù even in noisy environments. And I like that they did away with the Siri ‚Äútone‚Äù and made her more human like by responding with ‚ÄúHmm?‚Äù or ‚ÄúMmhmm‚Äù when you talked to her. Her response time has gotten so good that you don‚Äôt need to wait to listen for her to acknowledge you. Just give her your command and it works. I like the audible acknowledgement is just to help people bridge the gap between ‚Äúold Siri‚Äù and ‚Äúnew Siri‚Äù so they know she is listening.<br /><br />Lastly, sound quality is great, of course. It‚Äôs not the best sound experience for audiophiles and you‚Äôll want a much more expensive over the ear headset for that, but for in-ear buds, these are great. I have zero desire to walk around with a bulky headset on and these sound more than good enough for me. They let me disappear into my own world while out for a run and allow me to escape the noise of the city for a little while. That makes them priceless to me. So glad I picked them up!",0.96,,0.22512695637695637,,iPhone
"I like the way it works when it‚Äôs working, but it‚Äôs unreliable and fails to charge regularly without removing the case from the phone and recharging<br /><br />I‚Äôm going back to Mophie which worked perfectly with no problems on my previous iPhone for two years<br /><br />The worst thing is that Apple support on this case is awful. They repeatedly gave me incorrect information. I know more about the case and how it works than the Apple support agents.<br /><br />One Apple support agent actually told me I should go to an Apple store, because they might now something about the case.<br /><br />Here‚Äôs my review of the Mophie Access, which compares it to the Apple battery case:<br /><br />I returned two Apple battery cases because they never worked reliably. I went back to Mophie.<br /><br />Here are my comments:<br /><br />1. The Apple case is at least $50 more expensive.<br />2. The Apple case promises a 40-50 percent charge. Based on the complaints here, I‚Äôm expecting to get about the same 40-50% - which is all I was expecting.<br />3. This case is wireless to wireless, so it will lose some capacity, but it‚Äôs open at the bottom. The Apple case blocked the microphone, so you had to hold the phone at exactly the right angle for people to hear you, This case is completely open at the bottom, so there‚Äôs no blocking the microphone.<br />4. Swiping up from the bottom of the screen, which is a very important gesture on an iPhone XS Max works perfectly on the Mophie, but not as well on the Apple case.<br />5. It does get warm when charging, but not nearly as warm as the Apple battery case.<br />6. It is no more bulky than the Apple case. In fact, I think they‚Äôre almost identical in this regard. It‚Äôs a battery case, so it‚Äôs going to be hefty.<br />7. The buttons work just fine. In fact, they‚Äôre easier to push than on the Apple case and have a nice tactile click.<br />8. It is smoother than I might prefer. In this regard, the Apple case is slightly better.<br />9. Apple support is clueless about their battery case. They're not trained on it and know nothing about how it works, or the proper battery setting on the phone for best use. I assume that Mophie has the same excellent support I received on previous cases.<br />10. I initially thought that charging the phone first, then the case and discharging the case first, then the phone, which the Apple case does, would be a good idea, but all it‚Äôs doing is continuously charging the phone until the battery case is drained. The Mophie drains the phone and then uses the case to recharge the phone - and you get to control when this happens.<br /><br />I‚Äôd say that overall, most of the negative reviews I read were way off base. I‚Äôm happy I retuned the Apple case and bought the Mophie Access.",0.8800000000000001,,0.13390720390720395,,iPhone

"If you‚Äôre thinking about these and currently own the original style of AirPods, please check out my review below!<br /><br />Are these a replacement to the original AirPods? Not necessarily. I own these and two original style AirPods. I am an Apple fan girl and own one of everything they‚Äôve got. But even then, I‚Äôm on the fence about the Pro‚Äôs. First off...<br /><br />Comfort and Fit<br />If you‚Äôve ever tried out the PowerBeats by Dre, they fit just like them minus that extra ear anchor. It takes some getting used to but thanks to transparency mode, I don‚Äôt think I could really wear another pair of IEMs / earbuds again. They 100% will not make you feel like your ears are clogged and not can you hear your own voice as one would with earbuds.<br /><br />However, I‚Äôm hung up on the fit. I was one of the lucky few who the original AirPods fit just right. However, these just hurt after 20-30 minutes. I tried all the different sizes  of ear tips but none work. Ultimately, I wish Apple included foam versions of their ear tips. So be warned that these might hurt! Assuming they don‚Äôt hurt, then...<br /><br />Sound Quality<br />The sound quality is great. It‚Äôs nice and clear, balanced and at times not packing the bass I was possibly expecting. The HomePod has a very, very strong bass signature and I thought these would be similar. But, nope! When third party foam air tips come out, I‚Äôm pretty sure that will help the bass out. (Bass needs a good seal when it comes to earbuds.)<br /><br />Are these better than the original AirPods? Maybe. Because of that seal from the ear tips, the sound quality is drastically improved. With third party ear tips, the original AirPods sound pretty similar to these. I do appreciate the dynamic EQ which helps the sound a lot. But, be warned that they will sound like garbage if you have an EQ set in Apple Music on your iPhone. Make sure to set it to off or Late Night, otherwise they‚Äôll sound a lot worse! Ultimately, you won‚Äôt be disappointed and they sound great, better than the originals because of that sound seal, but not mind blowing!<br /><br />Battery Life<br />They‚Äôre pretty in par with the original AirPods with battery life even with Transparency and noise cancellation on. You can go all day with these just like the originals!<br /><br />Speed<br />This is what I love about them the most! This is the reason why I prefer these over the original AirPods. The Pro‚Äôs are so much snappier with Handoff, switching from device to device, pausing and restarting, etc. They also more accurately get picked up by your iPhone and Apple Watch. I really wish they would upgrade the hardware in the original design just like these. (We‚Äôll see!) also, the Pro‚Äôs more intelligently go on standby when out of your ear, resume faster when they go in your ear, etc. They just do everything faster! I also appreciate the fact that you pinch the stem instead of tapping them. Whoever thought of tapping didn‚Äôt realize how uncomfortable that ‚Äúgesture‚Äù would be in practical usage.<br /><br />Overall<br />I love them but they‚Äôre like the cousins of the original AirPods.

"I will be listing the main cons of the iTouch as I feel it is more important than the pros when shopping for an item.<br /><br />Background: I have owned the device for the course of a couple of years roughly and have put it through the tests. I use this mainly as a smartphone without the cellular ability because I did not want to pay the extra $30 a month for data plan. This including from surfing the web, to watching videos, chats and emailing.<br /><br />Battery: I have to say, I am connected to Wifi about 90% of the time. It will last me maybe 3-4 hours if I use it constantly to surf the web and YouTube videos. On most days, I could get a full day out of it, but nothing as long I would imagine from advertisement.<br /><br />Camera: as we all know (or should know), it has a 0.7 MP rear camera. Enough said.<br /><br />Quality: To me, the biggest issue (there are many out there with the exact same problem I faced). The home button fail to work after a year of use. It started showing early signs when I would have to press harder for it to go to home or I have to press it down a certain way. It got to a point that I could not deal with it anymore and went to using the gesture mode, which takes up a block on the screen and I accidentally hit it every so often, annoying. Although I have to say, after using it for a year this way, it has become second nature to me and works just as marvelous as the home button.<br /><br />I never abused my hardware. It was always protected in an Otter box.<br /><br />Needless to say. I had stopped using this device months ago since I now own a tablet that works better to my needs. The only time I ever pick this device up is when I know I am going somewhere I cannot take my tablet with me (1 out of 7 days). It's a simple device that does what I need when I need it, but it could be had for a much cheaper and longer battery lasting device.",0.8800000000000001,,0.12903667214012043,,iPhone

"My previous Apple watch series 4 has lasted me over 4 years and is still working, however, the screen is slightly ghosting because of OLED burn in and the battery is now at 79% battery health and it recommends service. So, I figured I would upgrade to this new in box Apple watch series 7 with Milanese loop because of a great deal and a warranty with even a gen old product. However, opening it up it took almost 1.5 hours to get it to turn on from a completely dead state. Then took over 2 hours to download the watch update, then it took another hour and a half to get my previous watch info to download to this watch. Then it has to be set up as a new watch because it would not pair with phone. Then once that was set up, it needed to be reset up to link to iphone. Overall this was the entire afternoon getting this setup and I can't imagine any single person being okay with this. This is beyond unacceptable. I'm very much a tech guy and generally love technology until it really sucks like this experience.<br /><br />The watch will also not charge out of any of the six usb c ports I've tried that are rated 18 to 30 watts. Separate adapters. I've only found one single 20 watt anker adapter that will charge it and that's it. I can't imagine any other person being okay with this either. Include the original 20 watt adapter in the box if this is going to be this picky. My previous Apple watch never had one single issue really and always charged and basically never gave me a headache over 4+ years of daily use. And that was a base model gps series 4. This is normally an almost $800 watch new.<br />The Milanese loop also is very uncomfortable compared to previous versions I've owned, which I could wear extensively. This pulls the hair so bad it's awful. It also grinds the metal as it's going into the watch. Apple has seriously lost touch with the series 7 and I'm actually so annoyed with this experience my iPhone 14 pro max 1tb is about to be for sale and this is going back and I'm going to stick with my Pixel 7 that I'm currently typing this on which is much better in most ways. I've been a heavy apple user for a while but the iPhone 14 series and this apple watch series 7 experience seriously makes me think Google is heading in a much better direction with software experience, assistant, and even it's UI. The camera is also very noticeable better on the pixel 7. I do think the screen is brighter and nicer and the video is better on the iPhone, though. Also- apps are very much less fragmented on iOS in general. I guess that's why I currently have both OS'S.<br /><br />Anyhow, I can't recommend this watch less. The series 4 was a great watch. Never an issue. Better could always be better on apple watches, but this series 7 is missing the mark in every single conceivable way I can think. I'm shocked at apple in that they released this as an $800 watch. I didn't even mention the absolutely awful and cheap, hospital looking packaging this top end watch came in. Seriously, don't buy this. Maybe the series 8 and ultra is better but this is the worst product I've ever owned from Apple out of the box and it's not even close.",0.96,,-0.003054431906890918,,iPhone

"I am still getting into my new ipod touch 64G (4th gen) and absolutely love it! I haven't used the facetime software or all the game features, but still it is a great piece of equipment. Very slick, very easy to use, very slender and cool.<br /><br />However, if you have read all the otehr reviews, you will know that the camera quality is much lower than the iphone camera. I don't think it is as bad as people have said, especially considering how thin it is compared to the new iphone, but you know know about this. Also, it works well as a video/music player (for music, I think the classic is better), but for features that need connectivity (map, e-mail, facetime, online game, etc.), you must make sure to be near accessible and programmed WIFI connections at all times, which is not always easy. But this is a trade off considering an iphone or itouch that you need to decide for yourself.<br /><br />Finally, I am disappointed with the battery life. I can use my 80G ipod classic for almost an entire weekend nonstop without charging (only playing music). My touch seems to need charging after less than 2 hours with some applications.

"Im a big Apple fan, I have an iPhone, used to have an iMac, MacBook Pro, and I've got an iPad. I am very happy with the Apple products I've bought. It's important to know this because it helps give you a frame of reference for my review.<br /><br />As with all Apple products, it's packaged well. There isnt much for instructions on how to use it, but if you go to Youtube you can look at a few 1 minute videos of how to use it. It's easy to charge with the enclosed USB to Lightning cable. The charge port is on the bottom of the mouse so you can't charge it while using it. Thats not much of a problem as I charge my electronics at night while I am sleeping. Its recommended ""per Youtube folks"" that you let it completely discharge before recharging. This brings me to connectivity, the mouse uses Bluetooth on your computer. If you don't have Bluetooth then don't buy the Magic Mouse 2. I charged my mouse overnight and connected it to my MacBook Pro using Bluetooth. There is a switch on the bottom of the mouse that you have to turn on, which is when the switch turns green. Its not an LED, its just painted green so that you know its on. Then I went to settings, I then turned on Bluetooth and the computer paired automatically. The weight of the mouse is heavy as its made of aluminum and I'm sure the battery has some weight to it.<br /><br />Using the mouse is easy. There is the usual right and left clicks.

I don't know why Apple made the mouse streamlined like this but some people may find it a turn off. As for myself, its not a problem as I can deal with it.<br /><br />You can tell that the Magic Mouse 2 is a high quality product.

"Unpacking is a bit difficult, but not too bad. This is typical for Apple's super fancy packaging. Attaching the watch band is very easy and obvious. Next comes the pairing with your iPhone. This is not so easy or obvious but works quite well as long as you know your iPhone passcode and put the watch on top of your iPhone face down as suggested by the pairing software. Once synced with your iPhone you will be prompted to set a passcode for the watch. Do set it, but not until you have finished the total setup. Your watch now contains a lot of personal information that you should protect. When you take your watch off your wrist, the passcode request comes on very quickly, so if you want to work on your watch with it off your wrist, temporarily turn the passcode off from the settings icon. There are a couple of things you should do immediately in the settings mode. First, is to put all the icons in a list instead of the cute scattering of icons in the default mode. Second, is to swipe up from the bottom and put the watch in theater mode. This makes the watch silent except for haptic vibrations and turns the screen off (hugely increasing battery life, in my case, more than doubling the stated 18 hours). Two taps on the screen turns the screen back on for a short period. You can use your nose to turn on the screen if your other hand is occupied (your chin will not work). I am now sure you can receive and make phone calls in this mode. Holding down the side button will activate Alexa and allow voice commands such as ""Call John Smith"". After these two, use the U-Tube videos or the online watch manuals to further customize the watch.<br /><br />There are lots of entertainment features built into the watch and into your iPhone and plenty of apps to download if you feel the need.<br /><br />The biggest built-in is health monitoring if you feel the need to know your vitals (heart rate, oxygen levels etc.). Under health monitoring is fall detection. This could save your life and is one of the best reasons to own an Apple watch series 7 whether you are young or old.<br /><br />Why 4-stars instead of 5? It is all about the passcode when the watch is off your wrist. There needs to be a timer on the passcode so that it can be delayed for a few minutes or longer while you work on the watch's settings. As it is right now, you have to manually turn the passcode off while it is on your wrist and then remember to turn it back on in order to work on the settings off of your wrist.<br /><br />I highly recommend purchasing a screen protector, since this fairly large watch can bump into things and scratch the screen. It is much easier to replace a $2 screen protector (clear plastic covering) than it is to repair the screen.<br /><br />There is an interesting small battery-operated recharger for the watch that could be useful if you use the watch a lot while away from home or away from A/C power (in a car or plane) . Lopnord Wireless Charger for Apple Watch. It is so small that it fits in your pocket or purse and can recharge the watch at least one to one and a half times. I've got one and will review it separately and come back to this review when I am confident that it works well.

You would think for over $200 Apple would include a charging base instead of just a cord and 2.) You can forget about being able to read anything in the instruction book if youre over the age of 30. The print is just too freakin small. Why not just send a card in the box with a website to go to for the information you need???? I do love the product even though after a month I'm still trying to figure ut how to best utilze them....but then again I am old:),0.96,,0.2818181818181818,,iPhone
"My 16 year old son's high school requires an iPad for all classes. He started out with the iPad 4 but found it bulky to constantly carry around at school. He is used to having his iPhone 6 with him 24/7. When the larger iPad fell out of his backpack in the school parking lot and was accidently run over, we wanted to save a little money by replacing it with a smaller version. This was a great idea and he could not be happier with the iPad Mini 4! He likes that it has all the latest Apple capabilities yet it is smaller and lightweight. He can hold it like a phone and type his homework with his thumbs just like he texts on his phone. This is much faster (for him) than typing with the keyboard on his larger iPad. He also likes that it charges more quickly. This is especially important when he forgets to put it on the charger overnight and it needs it for school the next day.",0.9,,0.2270555555555556,,iPhone

"I love these pods but both have started to malfunction at about the exact same time (18 mos. after purchase).<br />I bought the 2nd pair b/c I loved the first pair so much. Initially when my Pods ran out of battery the noise cancellation/Bluetooth/and audio quality difference with anything else was so dramatically inferior I wanted to keep up the AirPod quality. So I treated myself to a 2nd pair and was able to 'keep the party going.'<br /><br />But after about 18mo's, randomly one Pod that had been charging for hours and hours, even overnight, in it's plugged in case would come out less than 10% charged.<br />Then it started happening more and more often.<br /><br />And then the same thing started happening with my 2nd pair.<br />Now I just expect it everytime. It's weird b/c then I put the one back in to charge and it only takes 10-15 min's to be matched back up w/ the other one at like 85%.<br /><br />Also, people are commonly telling me they can't really hear me when I use them for Bluetooth calls soI can't use them for that anymore.<br />SUCKS.<br /><br />I understand they aren't going to be new forever, but... for nearly $200 each?<br />DEFINITELY not worth it and not what I've come to expect from Apple as a proud and satisfied iPhone and MacBook owner.",0.96,,0.11832210998877664,,iPhone

"I buy nearly all my music on Amazon, so the music is in the MP3 format.  I bought the iPod Shuffle to replace a lost Sansa Fuze because Consumer Reports said the Shuffle plays music well and because I had heard that Apple products are easy to use.  But using it with MP3s is difficult.  The music has to be converted to Apple's AAC format because the iPod, unlike most other digital music players, doesn't play MP3s.<br /><br />The MP3 to AAC conversion took a long time and I'm sure there is some loss of quality along the way.  But I went along with it and then found that the iTunes software refused to recognize that my iPod Shuffle was connected.  After much wasted effort It turned out that the 1/8-inch multi-segment plug was not all the way in -- an easy error because it takes a great deal of force to get it fully inserted.  Finally everything was working, and the Shuffle plays music  It sounds good even though there is a theoretical loss of quality in the MP3-to-AAC conversion.<br /><br />But you can't specify what it will play -- only whether it is in the sequence in which it was saved or in a random sequence.  My old Sansa Fuze (which would be very expensive to replace now that it is out of production) was much better.  You just loaded in the MP3s as they are, the connector presented no problems, you needed no special software, and you got to choose what to play.

"Normally I do not review products that I do not buy at Amazon, but I am making an exception for the iPad Mini.<br /><br />Let me start by stating that all my gadgetry is Apple.  We own an iMac, iPod nano, two iPhones, and an iPad 3.  Suffice to say: we like Apple products.<br /><br />Honestly, the reason I bought the iPad mini 16G, WiFi was: one, it can fit in one hand; two, it is cheaper than a new iPad; and three, because I wanted it.<br /><br />So:  I've stated that I'm a loyal Apple customer and probably will be the rest of my life.  It might be that I'm biased when it comes to Apple products as are a large majority of Apple customers.<br /><br />I was apprehensive at first about the display.  When I found out the Mini wasn't using a Retina display, I nearly didn't buy one.  I love the beautiful resolution of my iPad 3.<br />Apple used the same 1024-by-768 as the iPad 2, BUT the screen is 7.9 inches.  In my opinion the display resolution is great.  Not iPad 3 great, but not as bad as I thought it would be.  I have to agree with Apple and say that the 7.9 inch screen is perfect for a smaller tablet.  +1 for Mini<br /><br />The Mini is 53% lighter than the iPad and 23% thinner--not a major selling point for me, but not a distraction either.  +1 for Mini<br /><br />The iSight 5 megapixel camera takes great pictures and shoots decent movies for what it is.  I've tried out the FaceTime and it works great--picture resolution is adequate.  +1 for Mini<br /><br />Speed:  The dual-core A5 provides this device with plenty of computing power.  I was impressed as I thought the Mini's speed would suffer as Apple was attempting to cheapen the product a bit.  It didn't.  Internet surfing is lightning fast!  +2 for Mini<br /><br />I'm satisfied with the battery life.  Apple says that the Mini has ten hours of battery life and they're pretty close.  +1 for Mini<br /><br />I love the aluminum unibody cover.  The thing is sweet looking: sleek, like I'm in a sci-fi movie using some futuristic device.  I heard one dude say it's sexy.  I'm not sure that I'd go as far as calling a hunk of aluminum, glass, and plastic sexy, but it is easy on the eyes.  Apple nailed it on the aesthetics of the Mini.  +2 for Mini<br /><br />At first, I was peeved about the Lightning connector (I still am a bit).  All my other devices have the old 30-pin connector.  I have only one cable to charge the Mini and four old cables that will eventually be obsolete.  The smaller port is great though--it looks much better, more compact and I understand why Apple did what they did...but it still sucks when you have multiple other Apple devices with the old port.  Everything has to change sometime, I guess.<br />-1 for Mini (not Apple's fault, my preference)<br />Hey: when the apps and widgets get boring Siri's there to ask millions of important questions to.<br /><br />I used an iBlason case to protect the Mini and so far like it: http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M0QLNUAECSUD/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm<br /><br />So with all that said and much more not mentioned: I'm a fan of the Mini, but I think the device was overpriced a bit.  I still paid the extra $130 over the Kindle Fire HD, because I prefer Apple, but after playing around with a friend's Fire HD 7"", I was impressed with the Fire and the price.<br /><br />In the end it was a matter of preference for me choosing Apple over Kindle.  I'm very satisfied with my purchase of the Mini and my kids love it too.  I would recommend the Mini to anyone and everyone.  Great product!<br /><br />*Update 11-20-12<br /><br />It has been several weeks of heavy use for the Mini and I have very little negative to say about the device.  Again, I bought it because it was Apple and for the Apps and because I like Apple products.<br /><br />I wish the external speakers were a little louder, but one can use headphones and be fine.  For our family uses the A-5 processor is adequate.  The device seems to stream the Time Warner App without buffering or glitches--I really cannot complain.<br /><br />Our Mini is used on and off all day long starting with a fully charged battery in the morning and about 10-15% life at bedtime (9:00pm-10:00pm).  That's using mostly gaming Apps and some video streaming.  For us, that's about right.  If a device's battery can make it through the day, I'm fine with that.",1.0,,0.24449922014260247,,iPhone

"My Wife and I bought ourselves these watches for our Christmas gifts to each other in 2018. We were looking for good fitness watches as well as accessories for our iPhones. She had a 7 plus and I have a 6S.<br /><br />First, the non-fitness aspects: It took roughly a month to really feel like I knew my watch fairly well. I use it a lot for notifications in meetings, quick responses when I‚Äôm on the road and for quickly pinging to find where my phone is. I also like it for the flashlight for times when I need to see but not have it too bright like getting ready in the morning before my wife and daughter wake up.<br />Unfortunately, the voice to text is somewhat lacking compared to my iPhone 6S. I find the interpretation is often way off on many words and you can‚Äôt just go back and change a word like you can on a phone. You have to repeat the whole sentence.<br />I also have trouble with getting Siri to auto trigger sometimes when I tilt my wrist up. I‚Äôm not sure why it works well sometimes and not at all other times.<br />The battery life is decent but I wish it could run longer for a watch. I feel like 2 days and maybe half a day more is the max you can go without charging it. It does charge fairly quickly though. I think around 2 hours.<br />I also wish there were more customizable faces. I can‚Äôt find the perfect face with everything I want on it. Animation, rings, weather, time, date and quick workout access.<br />Overall, I‚Äôd rate this watch about a 3 & 1/2 stars for its non-fitness aspects. If the Siri worked better and talk to text worked better I would probably give it another star. Also, sometimes it‚Äôs hard to hear me if I‚Äôm in my car as well as hear other people on it. It‚Äôs still a good accessory though.<br /><br />Now, onto the fitness aspects of the watch.<br /><br />I loved this watch for fitness reasons when I first got it. It inspired me to workout more and around Feb I began completing my workout goals (rings) and actually begin losing weight. It helped me to lose 20 lbs. yay!<br /><br />It wasn‚Äôt until about a month ago I started having issues. What happened? It stopped giving me credit for some of my exercises. For example, I went on a 23 minute walk outside today with the Outside walk workout running and got 11 minutes of credit for it. I have since researched the issue to find out this was done on purpose by Apple. Or so they are claiming.<br /><br />What‚Äôs going on? Apple has an algorithm that apparently determines your heart rate, speed of walking and health information and if you don‚Äôt meet the minimum for a ‚Äúbrisk walk‚Äù then you don‚Äôt get credit for it in the exercise minutes. What idiot at apple decided this was a good idea? A healthy heart will have a lower beat rate but it doesn‚Äôt mean you aren‚Äôt exercising for that duration. This puts me off tremendously and I feel there needs I be a choice for the user to turn this auto calculation off and be able to use the workouts as they were before the change was made.<br /><br />Apple even gives a work around for this issue that makes no sense to me. They say just use the ‚Äúother‚Äù workout and it will count as workout time. But what about the distance? The gps map? The ability to track how many walks you‚Äôve taken and for how long? I feel like they‚Äôve brushed it off and not addressed the issue here at all and that attitude towards the consumer‚Äôs concerns is a major turn off for me. What should be a solid 4-5 star fitness watch is now a 1 star fitness watch until this is addressed by apple.<br /><br />Until then, I can not recommend this watch as a fitness accessory. It‚Äôs a decent accessory to the iPhone if you need it for the non-fitness reasons.",0.96,,0.21258865248226952,,iPhone

"These are great and all but for $150+, no way, not worth it.  I just received these as a gift for my BDAY from my GF and prior to this I was using the TaoTronics Bluetooth earbuds, similar to the PowerBeats2 and I can honestly say that the quality and sound are very much comparable.  There's no way I can justify the price difference and I'd much rather purchase the TaoTronics Bluetooth earbuds over these at $20ish.<br /><br />I guess the only benefit I'd give these over the other Bluetooth ear buds is that these have the hooks to go over the ear to help the earbuds from falling out and staying in place - so it's really suited for those who have rigorous workouts and cardio.  I've always thought the 'Beats' brand was over-rated and you're really just paying for the marketing and branding of these earbuds.  Besides that, there's nothing else that make these more worthwhile then the other more affordable ear buds.  Even my skullcandy inkd 2 wired earbuds sound better than these.<br /><br />UPDATE 10/3/2015 - So I changed out the earbud ends to the larger ones it came with and wow they made a huge difference.  The sound is much better, cleaner, and deeper since the earbuds now fit much more snug in my ear canal and there is much less sound leak.

"As I sat on my computer today, perusing options to buy another set of Apple‚Äôs AirPods Pro, it dawned on me: it‚Äôs about time I write a review for these bad boys, because I‚Äôve used mine almost daily for the past year-and-a-half.<br /><br />  If you‚Äôre new to the world of Apple‚Äôs headphones and earbuds, you may not realize that Apple offers three options that will suit your needs much better than the standard, wired ear buds that come with some Apple products, like iPhones and iPods:<br /><br />1: Airpods, which are the wireless companion to the standard earbuds the you‚Äôll find accompanying some Apple devices. These Airpods are the size of the standard earbuds, if you were to cut the cords off at the very base of the earbud stems. They come in a small, square-shaped charging case with round corners, which serves as a convenient storage location for your AirPods, and accepts the standard Lightning USB cable to charge.<br />2: AirPods Pro, which have all of the features at the standard AirPods, plus a more comfortable fit, better sound quality, and two modes of sound augmentation, being a noise-canceling mode and a ‚ÄúTransparency mode‚Äù, which allows you to listen to your surroundings while you listen to your music, podcasts, or other media.<br />3: Lastly, Apple added the Airpods Max to their fleet this year. These are over-the-ear headphones that offer similar features to the AirPods Pro, minus the charging case. You‚Äôll find that these headphones have better noise-cancelation and sound quality than the AirPods at the cost of a larger profile and price tag.<br /><br />Please note: While the cases for the AirPods and AirPods Pro accept the lightning cable to charge, they can also be placed on a mag-safe charging pad to charge. With that said, I‚Äôve only btested the AirPods Pro with the lightning cable, as I do not own a wireless charging pad.<br /><br />So, Let‚Äôs Focus on the AirPods Pro<br /> Keeping in mind that this post has no ties to any outside entity, so my opinions aren‚Äôt being skewed with the intent of pleasing an advertiser, I absolutely love my AirPods Pro, and I take them with me just about everywhere. I‚Äôm on my second pair, because they are easy to lose due to their compact case, but that small profile is also a big part of why I love these earbuds, so it‚Äôs a bit of a paradox. If you can see, this won‚Äôt be much of a problem for you, but if you‚Äôre visually-impaired, it‚Äôs another story. With that said, the AirPods Pro are capable of being used with Apple‚Äôs ‚ÄúFind My‚Äù app, but you have to be pretty close to the case for this feature to be beneficial if you have a visual impairment. Keep in mind that I‚Äôm also deaf in one ear, so your mileage may vary here, but I just don‚Äôt think the sound is strong enough to truly tout this as an outstanding feature; I‚Äôd say the ‚ÄúFindMy‚Äù capability is more of an afterthought that Apple added to increase the length of the ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù list for these earbuds. But I‚Äôll save the rest of my opinions until the wrap-up at the bottom of this post. Let‚Äôs get into some facts.<br /><br />What‚Äôs in the box?<br /><br />  First of all, the packaging for the AirPods Pro lives up to the standard we‚Äôve come to know as Apple has grown into the Titan of a company that it is. It‚Äôs sleek, compact, and satisfying to open. Inside the box, you‚Äôll find your AirPods Pro and accompanying charging case, three different sizes of the silicone tips that form the seal necessary for effective noise cancellation, one lightning to USB-C cable, and some documentation.<br /><br />Features<br /><br /> With the price being around 80dollars more than the AirPods with charging case, it‚Äôs a no-brainer  that the AirPods Pro are the better choice, whether you‚Äôre in need of noise cancellation or you just have an extra 80 bucks burning a hole in your pocket, and you‚Äôre about to see why.<br /><br />Comfort and Convenience<br /><br /> Being someone who owns a pair of ears that don‚Äôt cooperate with standard Apple earbuds very well, the comfort and secure fit provided by the silicone tips of the AirPods Pro are almost at the top of my list when it comes to benefits of these earbuds. With only three size choices, you may feel that two different sizes provide the same level of comfort and sound quality, but the AirPods run a ‚Äúfit test‚Äù during setup to determine which of the tips are the perfect fit for you. The only feature that tops the comfort of the AirPods Pro is their ability to seamlessly alternate between the noise cancellation and transparency modes.<br /><br /> On top of these two stand-out features, Voiceover users won‚Äôt notice any latency between executing gestures on-screen and their devices‚Äô TTS output, which is a somewhat common occurrence with other Bluetooth headphones.<br /><br />Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode<br /><br />Living in the heart of the city, I constantly switch between the two modes while I travel with my cane, as I come to street crossings and need to hear traffic, or when I‚Äôm on long spans of uninterrupted sidewalk, where I can block-out the sounds of the city while I make my way to my next crossing. And, while the noise cancellation of the AirPods Pro is incredible for their size, I do want to note that they don‚Äôt provide as much soundproofing as an over-the-ear headphone, like the Bose Noise Cancelling 700 Headphones. And if you‚Äôre curious, you can find my review of those headphones here.<br /><br />On the other hand, when in transparency mode, the AirPods utilize both their inward and outward-facing microphones to bypass the sound-masking that comes with having standard earbuds in your ears, leaving ones‚Äô ability to hear their surroundings unimpeded. And when I say unimpeded, I mean it; when it comes to listening to my surroundings, the transparency mode provides a level of clarity I haven‚Äôt experienced with another pair of earbuds- and especially not with over-the-ear headphones.<br /><br />Sweatproof<br /><br /> I also wear my AirPods Pro when I lift weights, and on my way both to and from my Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu gym: Two times when there is a lot of sweat and a lot of movement, and so far, their sweat/splashproof design has withstood everything I‚Äôve subjected them to. It‚Äôs not uncommon for me to wash them under a faucet, and again, they still work just fine. I haven‚Äôt submerged them into a vessel of water though, and Apple has outlined that this would surpass the limits of the AirPods resiliency.<br /><br />Battery life and Charging case<br /><br /> While I haven‚Äôt been able to find any specific details as to the battery life of the charging case itself, one comparison article I found stated that the standard AirPods can be used for 4.5 hours before needing to be charged by their case, while the AirPos Pro will survive for 5.5 hours. Do keep in mind that these measurement are approximate, as the battery life may vary greatly, depending on distance from the connected device, volume level, mode, and many other factors.<br /><br />Alright, but how do they sound?<br /><br /> My AirPods Pro deliver a surprising level of sound quality, whether I‚Äôm listening to audiobooks, podcasts, or music. They are undeniably the best pair of earbuds I‚Äôve ever owned, and I‚Äôve had a hard time transitioning back to standard Bluetooth earbuds at times when my Airpods Pro are charging. Spoken-word content sounds crisp and professional, with no fuzziness looming around the speaker‚Äôs voice, so I‚Äôm not often distracted by poor audio quality, unless I have an unstable wi-fi connection. And, the AirPods Pro even add an extra layer of depth to stories that have occasional music or sound effects entwined throughout their duration.<br /><br /> Finally, when listening to music, the AirPods Pro have a surprising amount of power; I haven‚Äôt had the feeling that I‚Äôm missing any part of a song because of their bass output when in noise cancellation mode. However, When in noisier settings with other music in the background, like at a public gym, I do find myself longing for my aforementioned, over-the-ear  Bose headphones, because I can hear too much of the gym‚Äôs music over my own.<br /><br />Wrapping Up<br /> If you know you want to buy a pair of wireless earbuds, I can‚Äôt recommend the AirPods Pro enough. While I do believe they are a tad pricey, inflated prices come with the territory when it comes to Apple products, and I feel like I‚Äôve gotten my moneys worth from these earbuds. With that said, if you‚Äôve decided it‚Äôs time to track-down a pair for yourself, I suggest shopping around. While prices fluctuate everywhere, several articles I‚Äôve skimmed mentioned that Amazon occasionally offers much-better AirPods and AirPods Pro deals than Apple.",0.96,,0.14004647313470844,,iPhone
"I bought my Airport Express with some Christmas money this year (2009). I already have a good, functioning wireless router in my home that covers my entire home. I bought this unit solely for the AirTunes functionality, and it works great! After a quick and easy setup, I had AirTunes running in my home. From unboxing to up-and-running, a grand total of about 10 minutes. AirTunes saved me the trouble of having to lug my portable alarm clock to dock my iPhone on to enjoy music in my living room.<br /><br />I haven't had a chance to try the USB printer sharing or actually using it as a standalone wireless router, but I'm looking forward to taking it with me this Feb. to a conference to use in my hotel room to secure my network connection.<br /><br />All-in-all, a great buy!",0.82,,0.38055555555555554,,iPhone

"This was a much needed upgrade for me. I've been using a mid 2011 Mac Mini server model for a couple years and while still great, it's going on 10 years old now. In terms of performance, as expected the new M1 Mac Mini is a fantastic upgrade.<br /><br />Everything has been fairly smooth so far, with only a couple hiccups that I had to resolve. First, it would seem that having wifi enabled was causing interference with my bluetooth connections. This was fairly inconsequential as I'm using an ethernet connection for online so I simply disabled wifi and the problem was resolved.<br /><br />Second, I could not watch any Amazon Prime videos and kept getting an error. Long story short, you need to enable Rosetta on your Mac Mini. It's a software that converts Intel based applications to run on the new Apple chip. Well, at least that's my understanding of it. I had to do a little digging on the internet but apparently you're typically asked if you want to install Rosetta but this isn't what happened for me. I had to figure out how to do it manually and luckily found a post online that explained it. Granted, this was using the Chrome browser. If you use Safari then you won't have to worry about it as movie playback on Safari worked regardless.<br /><br />Other than that everything has been fantastic. I paired this up with an external 2TB SSD for more storage and am also now able to sync up my iPhone 11 with this new Mac. So glad I upgraded and for the price I'm simply blown away. For years now I've figured that if I wanted a top performance Mac Mini I was going to have to shell out $1000+ but it looks like things have changed and I couldn't be happier.",0.9400000000000001,,0.17718129571577848,,iPhone

"Since picking up the iPad Pro this winter, it's become my go-to device. I originally bought it for a couch-surfing device so I didn't need to quint at my tiny iPhone. But this quickly became my everything device. I now use it for:<br /><br />* Work (emails / research)<br />* Importing photos with the optional SD card reader<br />* Professional photo editing (Lightroom CC with full access to profiles and presets)<br />* Podcast editing (with Ferrite Studio - use the SD reader to import from my H4N)<br />* Fun (Kindle reading, Netflix, YouTube, Surfing, etc).<br /><br />I have a $2000 PC sitting pretty idle now, as this has been able to do it all.

"After giving these a glowing review and 5 stars 3 days after I got them; I wanted to make sure that people know that fondness was shortlived. I am retuning them because the ear fit test stopped working first on the right one and then on both. There  is an audible buzz in my right earbud when I talk to Siri or on the phone and the noise cancelleation was sporadic (probably due to ear fit). Apple replaced right earbud to no avail...

"I picked up the iPad Air 2 locally as soon as it was available.  I have owned tons of tablets and convertibles laptops.  i owned both the iPad 1 and iPad 2. Below are some of my thoughts on the iPad Air 2 and how it compares to the competition.<br /><br />‚úî PROS:<br /><br />- A thin, light design<br />- A great HD display<br />- Faster than its predecessors<br />- Among the best cameras you will find in a tablet<br />- The best ecosystem of any mobile platform<br />- Often enjoys better enterprise support than other tablets<br />- iOS 8 Continuity features such as Handoff, Phone Calling, Instant Hotspot, and SMS<br />- Touch ID works 99% of the time<br /><br />‚úî CONS:<br /><br />- No SD Card Slot<br />- No USB or HDMI ports, although lightning cable adapters are available<br />- A tad big if portability is a requirement<br />- More expensive than comparable tablets, including the iPad Air 1<br />- Lower capacity battery than the iPad Air 1<br />- Marginal update over the $100 cheaper iPad Air 1<br /><br />‚úî IPAD AIR 2 vs NEXUS 9<br /><br />Neither the iPad Air 2 nor the Nexus 9 (nor the SAMSUNG GALAXY TAB S) offers much to convince you to switch platforms.  If you are undecided on the platform to choose, choose the iPad if you want the best ecosystem, better tablet centric experience, ease of use for non-sophisticated users, and better enterprise support.  Choose the Nexus 9 for a customizable OS, a more techie centric OS, widgets (come on, Apple!!!), or if you make great use of Google Apps.  And as much as I like the Apple Siri App, I much prefer Google Now.<br /><br />Basically, if I‚Äôm buying a tablet for me or my techie little brother, I‚Äôm buying an Android Tablet.  For my parents, my grandparents, or my kids I‚Äôm buying an iPad... or a Kindle. ;-)<br /><br />‚úî IPAD AIR 2 vs WINDOWS TABLETS<br /><br />Unless you need to run desktop apps on your tablet, you will be happier with an iPad over any Windows Tablet.  The iPad has a much better tablet centric experience at this point.  Perhaps Windows 10 will change that.  For now, Windows Tablets currently see a big gap in terms of usability, available tablet apps, and price/performance ratios.<br /><br />‚úî IPAD AIR 2 vs KINDLE FIRE HDX 8.9<br /><br />IPad users enjoy probably the best ecosystem of apps, accessories, and exclusive content.  Niche apps are often made first for, or are exclusive to iOS.  iPads have seen more support in the enterprise and in educational institutions.  In addition to all of this, iPads are also great devices.  If you have a Mac, use an iPhone, require apps or content exclusive to iOS, are already invested in iTunes purchases, or any combination of the above, you are probably better off getting an iPad.<br /><br />However, if you are open to considering another device, the Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 should be at the top of your list.  It‚Äôs a great device, it‚Äôs cheaper than a new iPad, and offers a lot in terms of ecosystem and optional benefits.<br /><br />Ultimately, I chose the HDX 8.9 over the iPad because I‚Äôm an Amazon Prime Member and I enjoy having access to so much ‚Äúfree‚Äù content.<br /><br />‚úî IPAD AIR 2 vs IPAD AIR 1<br /><br />The iPad Air 2 is the best iPad ever.  It‚Äôs faster, thinner, has more ram, and has a better camera than the iPad Air 1.  It also has Touch ID which, to me, is the biggest enhancement the Air 2 has over the Air 1.<br /><br />I‚Äôm not certain that the iPad Air 2 is $100 better than the iPad Air 1, however.<br /><br />The iPad Air 1 is also a great device.  For many people, I‚Äôd recommend getting an iPad Air 1 32GB and save $50 over getting the iPad Air 2 16GB.  If you have an ‚ÄúiPad 3‚Äù, you should probably keep using it until the ‚ÄúiPad Air 3‚Äù comes out.  Other than guys I know who are willing to pay for the latest and greatest gadget, I don‚Äôt know for who I would recommend the Air 2 over Air 1.<br /><br />‚úî BOTTOM LINE<br /><br />As I said above, the iPad Air 2 is the best iPad ever.  I just have a hard time recommending it over the $100 cheaper iPad Air 1.  Touch ID and the improved camera are great.  But are they $100 great?  Answer that and you‚Äôll be able to decide which among them you will choose.  Yes, Air 2 is faster but most people won‚Äôt notice the difference.<br /><br />I‚Äôll be re-gifting my iPad Air 3 (I planned to do this before buying it).  I have a loved-one that will appreciate having the latest and greatest iThing.  For me, I still prefer Android over iOS.  The 4th gen Kindle Fire HDX 8.9, coupled with an Amazon Prime subscription, is still my top tablet choice.  The Nexus 9 and Galaxy Tab 4 S would be next on the list.<br /><br />The nice thing is, whether you choose an iPad, Kindle, Nexus, or Galaxy Tab, you are going to get a great device!  Leave the tablet wars to the fan boys and enjoy which ever tablet you choose.",0.9199999999999999,,0.3777785293410294,,iPhone

"Challenges: occasionally doesn't charge when plugged in, which you discover only when you need it.  I listen to podcasts and update the playlist daily.  The older shuffle allowed you to drag and drop the podcasts to the shuffle and arrange the podcasts in any order.  This version doesn't allow that so you have to use playlists and add extra steps to make it work.  The On off switch is also the shuffle, continuous play switch.  To play a playlist in sequence means you have to carefully turn the switch to the middle setting.  If you go too far you skip to a random podcast, then you have to jump around to find the one you were listening to.  About a third of the time, when you sync the shuffle, iTunes won't sync properly and loses which podcasts you listened to or where you were in a particular podcast.  This whole thing is pretty lame.  My old iPod shuffle version 2 worked much better.",0.9,,-0.0008771929824561431,,iPhone
"I am a fan of the Beats by Dre brand in general and I have had my Beats headphones for 3 years now and they are still going strong. However, these speakers are a terrible brand extension for Beats.<br />PROS:<br />-The size is really nice. It is really easy to hold in your hand and easily packs into a backpack.<br />-The physical volume buttons are great. A lot of cheaper bluetooth speakers rely on the device synced with the speakers for volume control. This can sometimes lead to software malfunctions, but you dont have to worry about that with the Pill.<br />-The color choice is excellent.<br />-The beats button on the front is really convenient for play/pause and pairing new devices.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-PRICE!!!! There is nothing about this device that establishes it as a premium bluetooth speaker that compares with the likes of the Bose Soundlink. It is the same price as the Bose set and it has far inferior sound quality, lower volume, and less features. This speaker should cost $100, not $200.<br />-The sound quality is lacking by a mile. I got the Pill and the $65 iHome speaker for Christmas and I cant tell a difference in bass quality or volume. The bass and volume is exactly the same quality. The overall tone and feel is better than the iHome, but not even comparable to the Soundlink Mini.<br />-Every time you unplug the Pill from the charger, the music stops. I've also had connectivity issues with my computer. When I play Pandora and skip a song, Pandora will just keep skipping songs and it has to be restarted. Ive tried this on my iPhone and the same issue happened with Pandora and Spotify.<br />-While the Pill has more speakers and a better design, I would take the iHome over the Beats any day because of how rugged they are. The Pill seems like the slightest drop would cause the metal wire screen to dent forever.<br />-The sound quality of the Pill is better than the iHome, but nowhere near that of the Bose Soundlink mini. For the same price as the Pill, the Bose Soundlink has wireless charging, physical buttons for every function, and sound quality that is unrivaled in comparably priced speakers.<br /><br />Botton line is that these speakers are WAY overpriced. The sound quality is extremely lacking and there are too many issues right now. If you're going to spend $200 on bluetooth speakers, buy the Bose Soundlink Mini. The Beats brand name is not worth it in this case.",0.86,,0.19362761866110081,,iPhone

"Update 10/13/15 (changed from 4 star to five): Having a bit more experience at this point with the headphones, I can say I do not regret buying them at the original $300 price point. They are much more versatile than just a gym headphone. I use them for travel and basically any headphone usage period. The mic lets in some ambient noise, so it's not the best system, but works okay when necessary. The only other negative is that one of the mechanisms for adjusting the length on either side for different size heads/relative ear positions has loosened. Functionally it doesn't make any difference, but it annoys me all the same. The battery is pretty fantastic after nearly a year. It usually lasts me about a week to a week and a half of normal gym usage and occasional additional usage. I rarely even have the cord available because I have almost never had occasion to use it, except with my laptop which lacks bluetooth. Also, I can't really tell any difference between corded and cordless sound quality. Maybe if you have more distinguishing ears than I. The sound has not diminished whatsoever, and they look basically the exact same as when I bought them. The case is dirty from getting tossed in my gym bag every day, but has protected the headphones better than anticipated. I also would say that the fit is a bit less tight after this amount of time, but still functions very adequately. I have tried to address questions as they come up. Good luck.<br /><br />Original Review: First off, I only use these for the gym. That is the only reason I bought them. I hate when the cord gets in the way during a lift, and my ears are poorly shaped for earbuds I guess, because I can't stand them. Also, not an audiophile. I listen to rock and rap at the gym, and that's all I need these for. I'm not concerned with &#34;high hats&#34; or clear treble. I just want to get down and dirty with the weights. Also, I use with my iPhone 6 exclusively, and I have never tried them with the cord. Additionally, I haven't used the phone feature, since I work out early mornings. Anyway, that's my disclaimer.<br /><br />Good: Sounds great, solid, but not overbearing bass. I can tweak the EQ on my iPhone 6 when I want more or less bass. They get loud. Uncomfortably loud, if you want. That's a good thing, so I can crank the sound when I'm on my last set. I love the simplistic controls on the outside of the earpiece. Play and pause, volume, skip track, go back a track. Very easy to use without looking. The earpiece foam is comfortable. I usually have them on for 1-1.5 hours and I haven't had any discomfort at all. When I wear earbuds, they start to hurt after about 45 minutes. The case works well, for a soft case. Also, they look pretty nice. Not so bulky that I look like a douche at the gym. I tried a few other pairs, but they were too clunky for my taste. Great sound, great comfort, great looks.<br /><br />Bad: Don't like the gloss finish. They should have a matte option. It looks fine, but it gets really smudgy and dirty, which I am not fond of. The case is padded, but not a hard case, which makes me nervous with a $300 pair of headphones. I worry they will break in my gym bag. And speaking of $300, the price is steep. I don't regret spending the money, because they have improved my gym experience a TON, but still, that's a lot of dough. Also, this isn't really the headphones, but be warned that streaming music services (Spotify, Pandora, etc.) aren't as loud as songs you have downloaded to your music player, whether that be an iPhone or Android device. So if you really crank your tunes at times, that could be a problem. These have no noise cancellation, which I don't care about, so not good or bad for me.<br /><br />I love these headphones, they do exactly what I want them to do. I can't comment on durability yet, but they are nearly the perfect gym headphone for me. The price is the main drawback, so you'll need some scratch if you want to step up to these wireless Beats.

"Thanks in part to this product, I am a cord cutter  -- or a cord loosener at least-- that is, someone who is weaning the household off Comcast.  We've scaled back our cable TV package after going nearly full time to Internet-supplied video. The programs we would normally ""miss"" by not paying through the nose for various tiers of channels (most of which we would never use) are largely available through other non-cable means including iTunes.  What we can't find on Netflix or Hulu or Tv.com, we can usually find on iTunes for purchase, as well as back episodes and full seasons.  Even while purchasing some of these a la carte now, we spend a fraction of what we did. The reason this works is that the Apple cable does a pretty decent job of feeding our downloads into the HDTV, complete with good sound quality (TV is tethered to home stereo).  The component cable works noticeably better than the composite-cable version we had before (and now use on the road).  It is not perfect picture, but serviceable for certain.  In addition to iTunes, we still rely on DVDs (mostly netflix rentals or a few purchases of favorites) for highest quality sound and picture experience. In addition, we cabled a laptop to the HDTV and using WiFi can stream a wealth of content options. DVDs, downloads,and streaming -- the three main tools of cord cutting.

"Well, these are for sure made by Apple. I don't mean that as a bad thing. Apple has a great reputation when it comes to making things feel premium. The new Airpods Pro are no exception. they have very little weight in your ears, and the material is similar to what we've gotten used to with the previous versions of the Airpods.<br /><br />I've heard other people talk about how amazing the sound quality is. Every single one of them were switching from the regular Airpods. To that end, yes, they are better sounding. They have richer mids and a fuller base. The thing is that you can get sound quality of this caliber for very little compared to these earphones. their biggest competitor, Samsung, offers an in-ear option with even better EQ balance for less than half the price.<br /><br />What makes the Airpods Pro, well, Pro is the other features that come with them. Currently there are very few earphones with ANC, and the tech packed into the Airpods Pro is exceptional. The other main feature, ""transparency mode"" is also fantastic. Unlike ANC, most other new earphones have this feature. the Samsung Buds also have this feature, but Apple's implimentation is a cut above other brands in this regard. Sounds coming from outside actually sound natural, instead of like they were put through a $2 microphone like in the Samsung Buds.<br /><br />One other feature I am very pleased with is the lack of microphonics, and sealing quality of the earphones.  This has been a major issue for many other in-ear headphones for me. It becomes difficult to walk, or hear yourself talk with them in because of all the extra sounds that you have to deal with. Apple claims that the ventilation ports on the Airpods Pro prevent that, and it seems that this works. While not completely absent, the low pitched ""thud"" that accompanied each step was much less noticeable than any other in-ear option.<br /><br />Overall if you are not an audiophile junkie these are the best no-compromise option for wireless in-ear headphones right now, even if you are using an android phone it is still worth it to pick up these! Any other issues I have with the Airpods Pro are issues that I have across all of apple's Airpods and their implementation on the iphone ios.",0.96,,0.0824741108564638,,iPhone

"The number of 5 Star reviews say it all.  I use a Samsung Note 20 Ultra running Android and have tried all of Samsung's earbuds.  Nothing comes close to the sound quality of these Apple Pro's and I've been using these for over a year now.<br /><br />All earbuds have decent SOUND quality. Few have good MIC quality. These Apple earbuds are excellent in that respect.<br /><br />What sets these Apple earbuds apart is that they double as high-end hearing aids.  My hearing is not the greatest. And these earbuds have a trick.  Press and hold the stem for one second and the world comes to life.  You can hear things you normally wouldn't.  Better yet, you can make calls in this mode, allowing you to be super aware of what's going on around you and still be focused on the caller.  Press and hold the stem again (on a call or not), and sounds are cancelled (except the caller) and I personally hate that head stuffy feeling and avoid using this mode (except possibly on a plane while listening to music).<br /><br />These are sensational earbuds, but they aren't perfect. First, they work fine on Android, but they don't provide the slick integration that iPhone users get (first class on an iPhone that my wife has).  Secondly, the battery life is not good at all on these.  I can get about 2.5 hours of use before needing a recharge. But that's because they are loaded with tech and working hard.  Finally, I also dislike in-canal earbuds, which these are.  I tolerate it because of how well they work otherwise.  If Apple or someone can make a version of these that don't enter the ear canal (I don't care about noise cancelling, just give me the sound enhancement feature on the current version), I would buy 5 pairs.<br /><br />I'm not an Apple user, but these earbuds have had me rethinking everything.

In-ear, instead of on-ear<br /><br />If your ear has a small cavum and the original airpods fit perfectly, then the Airpads Pro may be a tight fit/more uncomfortable, but seeing the in-ear design, the ear piece will go into the ear canal and the rest will float in place.<br /><br />Those with normal or larger cavum it'll fit well.<br /><br />Some may not like the ear piece going into their ear canal<br /><br />These ear phones are more for a closed environment than an open one<br /><br />Seeing that it's an in-ear design, you may feel this hollow air effect going on unless you turn on transparency mode (more on this later) or play music with active noise cancelling on<br /><br />Seeing that it's in-ear, it has a tighter grip, better for joggers, those who shake their head around a lot for some reason, or if you run up stairs often. If you have an intense workout regimen and/or do extreme sports and not mindful it still can fall out<br /><br />There's a Ear Tip Fit Test on app. There's several ear tips in box. When you turn on this feature in app it'll calibrate and suggest what ear tips are best listening experience for you<br /><br />If you lose the tips or get them dirty overtime, you can go to the Apple store and get replacement pair for around $4 or get cheaper 3rd party ones when they come out<br /><br />3.

Battery life<br /><br />Battery life varies depending on how far away you are from the device and volume you set. Battery depreciation over time. These are just rough estimates<br /><br />Pro in general has 4.5 listening time with active noise cancelling or transparency on. Airpods version 2 has 5 hours. Note Airpod version 2 does not have active noise cancelling or transparency mode.  You can get 5 hours with noise cancelling and transparency off, but most likely you're not going to unless you're really desperate for battery<br /><br />Pro has 3.5 talk time. Airpods have 3 hours<br /><br />Case both old 24 hours battery life<br /><br />Pro: 5 mins in case = 1 hour talk or listen time. Airpods 15min in case = 3 hours listen, 2 hours talk<br /><br />5.  Water/sweat resistant<br /><br />Now you can go to the gym and do cardio with them on.<br /><br />As mentioned before, tighter grip seeing that it's in-ear<br /><br />May survive light rain. Do not recommended going in the shower or dunk in the pool with it though<br /><br /> 6. Active noise cancellation, Transparency mode<br /><br />Airpods pro has 3 modes: Active noise cancellation, off and Transparency mode<br /><br />Active nose cancellation tries to block out outside noise while listening to music. I'd say it drowns out may 70%. If you focus to outside or aren't focused to music; you still may be able to pick out what's going on, but in general it does it's job.<br /><br />Off is just like the standard in-ear headphones, but with the hollow air sound when no music is playing<br /><br />Transparency mode. The black airflow grills let in outside sound so you're able to hear both outside sound and music same time. Think of it as open ear headsets.<br /><br />Unlike some in-ear headsets the black airflow grills prevent you from hearing yourself in your head when you talk<br /><br />7. Sound Quality<br /><br />Better than the previous version seeing the active noise cancelling and in-ear with more focused sound direcly into your ear canal. It's not $250 audiophile quality sound.  Better quality sound in lows and mids compared to non-pro version. If you ever tried the Power Beats Pro, it sound very similar to those<br /><br />You can hear callers better in a noisy environment and less likely raise your voice<br /><br />--Conclusion:<br /><br />Other than that, all other features are the same. Meant to be used on Apple devices. Very good ease of use for Apple users, and is in-style these days (shows social status). Sound quality is better that the non-PRO version, and you do get noise cancellation. There are other headphones that do it better sound in this price range, but may not be as convenient with pairing to Apple devices.",0.96,,0.1349705724986624,,iPhone
"Should have been a great find, &#34;Professionally Refurbished&#34;. I have another iPod Nano, whose battery is going on six years. I bought this unit 27 Mar 17 and the battery was dead by October. I took it to Apple, because it turned off, after unplugging it. They connected it to their server and it came back with a changed serial number, and couldn't replace the battery for me. The on/off switch wasn't working either. I still have every Apple product I've owned and they all still work. Whether this was an on-the-up refurbish job, it was done with shoddy parts and wasn't a Certified Apple Repair Center.",0.9,,0.04000000000000002,,iPhone
"Pros:<br /><br />Comfort/fit  - Easily the most comfortable earbuds I‚Äôve ever used. The standard AirPods would fall out of my ears constantly and would rub my ear. These fit my ear perfectly. They are small enough for me to wear them through out the day and notice them. No irritation and no falling out of the ears<br /><br />Microphone and sound clarity - I use these for hands free work calls on a regular basis. The microphone sounds just as good as my iPhone 12. Also, the sound of music is as clear as you can get. However, it did lack a little bass. I personally prefer clarity over bass in most situations.<br /><br />Size - These are significantly smaller than any other quality wireless earbuds on the market.<br /><br />Noise cancellation - the noise cancellation is above par. It cancels out nearly all peripheral background noise. It‚Äôs not 100% though, nor would you want it to be. The headphones provide just enough audio feedback to understand my surroundings but blocks enough for me to hear a voice on the phone while walking through a large crowd. These will save my hearing for sure. With noise canceling, I find myself reducing song volumes by 50%.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />Color - I really don‚Äôt like that these are white. Every little piece of ear wax is visible. The white case collects lint and dirt which is visible. The lid to the cade is magnetized and catches every single shard of metal. From my experience, the earbuds and the case will start to look dirty in just a few weeks.<br /><br />Pass through - These headphones are supposed to pass through volume from the outside of the appropriate setting is checked. I don‚Äôt notice a difference really. Everything still sounds like I have earplugs in my ears. This issue may be unique to me though. I have a rough time hearing with or without headphones. Regardless, this feature is a little disappointing<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend these earbuds for the previously mentioned reasons. I wish I could comment on the integration with MAC. If you are a MAC user, I highly recommend you check into how these headphones can auto swap between devices.",0.96,,0.1197050865800866,,iPhone

The first time I felt the shock I was a bit confused, and I think it might have knocked some common sense out of me because I left them on and it happened not once more but maybe 3 more times.

This is a concern as if this was to fall out, this defeats the purpose of even having a case thats not secure around the phone.

They slipped out of my ear from sweating while doing work around the house.  That's a bit disappointing.  For an in-ear product they are very nice but expensive.  I engaged the noise canceling option but people tell me it does a poor job.  I knew I could control the volume only from my iPhone but hopefully Apple will find a way around that on future versions.  I also have an over-the-ear Plantronics with controls on the unit itself and it's only about $70.00 with GREAT noise canceling and a mute button.,0.96,,0.010000000000000009,,iPhone

"I have an iPhone, I do professional software development on a Mac, I own an iPad Pro and the previous version of the AirPods, but let me say, this is a rare miss from Apple. None of the 3 sizes of tips could keep the AirPod Pros from slipping out of my ear, even when I was just sitting at my desk. Looking up the issue, I saw lots of suggestions of rigging the silicone tips with tape, which is not something you should have to do for $250 headphones.

"If you can believe it, there was a time in our history when people were skeptical of Apple‚Äôs AirPods, myself included. We poked fun at the wireless buds protruding from early adopters‚Äô skulls, their ears housing white plastic hoping to be reunited with the rest of their 3.5mm headphone cable.<br /><br />Shortly after we saw knockoff after knockoff and countless attempts by other companies to match the quality Apple provided. Some came close, but nothing matched the superior engineering and design that Apple puts into their products.<br /><br />The airpods pro offer wireless Qi charging so I think it‚Äôs fair to compare their price point to the previous version 2 airpods ($199). For $50 more you get a lot more bang for your buck.  Perhaps the most desired addition is the new Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), which uses both outer and inner microphones to deaden sound around you. It works beautifully, and makes you realize how damn loud the world is on a regular basis. They are also IPX4 sweat resistant, which gives you piece of mind when working out or wearing them in a light rain. The in-ear design of the AirPods Pro means you‚Äôll get much better sound quality compared to normal AirPods. Bass is deeper, voices are clearer, and there‚Äôs less of a tinny quality when you crank it up.<br /><br />Apple‚Äôs even got a fix for the ‚Äúnoise isolation‚Äù issue that affects in-ear headphones, which prevents you from hearing the world around you while listening to music with a snugly fit pair of earphones. Dubbed ‚ÄúTransparency mode,‚Äù the AirPods Pro use its ANC software and a pressure-equalizing vent to mix environmental noise with your audio. When it comes to Transparency mode, the AirPods Pro blow all of their competition out of the water. Where headphones attempting the same trick would give volume to silence or magnify sounds ‚Äî making a running faucet sound like a hyper-localized downpour, for instance ‚Äî the AirPods Pro makes everything sound, well, just as it should. Silence is (nearly) silent and conversations feel normal, without suffering from any delay or echo. While wearing them, I don‚Äôt feel the need to raise my voice a few annoying decibels in order to hear myself speak.<br /><br />One of the coolest new features is Audio Sharing, which lets you pipe audio from your iOS device to two different AirPods at once, essentially reviving the art of headphone-splitting, albeit in a less romantic manner. Bring the two AirPods close to the same iPhone, open their cases, and tap to pair and share.<br /><br />Instead of tapping your AirPods to pause a song or take a phone call, you‚Äôll pinch the AirPods Pro on their protruding stem. This is powered by what the company is calling it a Force Sensor, essentially a pressure-sensitive button on the stem of each earbud. Holding either stem cycles through noise canceling options, and a trip to your iPhone‚Äôs Bluetooth settings lets you customize different tapping actions.<br /><br />Average listening time is about on par with regular AirPods, topping out at about five hours before you‚Äôll need to charge. With the case, you can expect a full 24 hours of use. You can turn both Transparency mode and ANC off to get an extra 30 minutes of battery life.<br /><br />Of course, each upgrade of Apple‚Äôs AirPods has only gotten pricier, and the AirPods Pro are no different. At $249, they‚Äôre just as costly as noise-canceling earbuds from Bose or Sony. It‚Äôs also yet another ‚ÄúPro‚Äù device from Apple lacking a USB-C port, opting instead to use the Apple-exclusive Lightning connector like the AirPods before it. But the AirPods Pro offer so much bang for your buck it‚Äôs hard to fault the wireless earbuds for much at all.",0.96,,0.11545454545454546,,iPhone

"I ordered the AirPods Pro in mid March.  For the first ten weeks or so of use, I was very pleased with the quality of sound, the noise cancellation and the other features.  Then the left ear bud started dropping the Bluetooth connection or losing charge, sometimes with the charge disappearing while the bud was in the charging case.  I tried the various Apple and YouTube suggestions re cleaning the contact points on the bud and inside the case.  I tried disconnecting the AirPods Pro from my iPhone and reconnecting.  These measures all worked, but the effect was short lived.  I was hassling with the device on a daily basis.

"I bought the green Apple Watch to ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù from a Garmin Forerunner 945. Mostly to pair with my peloton and phone better. My garmin is a fantastic watch and in some ways I was spoiled by it. Seven days of battery life. Fantastic sleep and workout detection but I‚Äôll be honest it was overkill for what I needed. And in some areas it sucked (the garmin that is). Like staying paired to my phone and the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù functionality was kind of garbage too.<br /><br />Now on to the Apple Watch. Set up was a breeze. Like others mentioned the Watch does not come out of the box charged enough for updating and set up. It also does not come with a wall charger. But for most folks, this is no surprise as it mentions this in the description. An anker 20w usbc wall charger will cost $16. I digress.<br /><br />I plugged my watch in, and started the setup process. It took me about 20 min start to finish. You download the Watch app if it‚Äôs not on your phone already. Using the Watch app, you‚Äôre prompted to capture the Watch face via the phones camera and then likely also prompted to update the WatchOS.<br /><br />I did have to reset my watch back to factory settings after the update as it didn‚Äôt want to finish completing the setup, but this was easily done with no googling on my part. Just pressing the long button on the right side of the Watch face will exit the set up and prompt you to confirm a reset to factory settings.<br /><br />Now on to the Watch itself. The sleep tracking is mediocre, as I said I‚Äôm used to my old garmin which would even tell me how much deep, light and rem sleep I got. Same with a Fitbit.<br /><br />The stand functionality is wonky too. I noted that just waving my hand around sometimes would register as another hour of standing.<br /><br />And the battery life. I get about 24 hours of battery life right now. It takes about 30ish minutes to charge to fill battery from around 10-15%. I bought a third party (anker) charging station for my AirPods, Watch and iPhone. It sits at my computer so I can easily plop everything down once a day for a charge.<br /><br />Would I buy an Apple Watch again after a week of ownership? Probably‚Ä¶ are there things that can be improved for $400+. Absolutely. Does my spouse now want his own Apple Watch? Yes.",0.96,,0.19432686654908876,,iPhone

Now once it ‚Äúpaired‚Äù it was once again needing a Watch app update to fully connect.<br /><br />Another downside. No charging block included.

"I laughed recently when I was told about an outlaw (an in-law's in-law) who read my wife the riot act because we use Apple products. It took me back to the time a number of years ago that I did the same to people who chose Macs over PCs. That was in the days before iPhones and iPads, even before iPods. At the time, it seemed that everybody except a few college students was using machines that ran on windows.  I remember bragging about how great my laptop was and what I could do with it.<br /><br />Fast forward to today, when we use an iMac at home, iPads for a variety of tasks and I carry an iPhone. I have gone through a succession of MacBooks, from a basic MB to a MB Pro that I loved. I had reached the place, however, that I just carried my iPad with me in a nice Zagg case with keyboard. I wasn't sure I would ever carry a laptop again.<br /><br />My travel got bumped up a bit this year and I found some weakness with my iPad.  I'm a touch typist who found that the loss of my bluetooth keyboard or airplanes was more than a small disruption.  I was also missing some robust software that just couldn't be matched by the company's IOS app.  Therefore, I decided to try out the 11.6-Inch MB Air.  Here is what surprised me:<br /><br />1. This Air is so small and light that I have no problem carrying it and my iPad with a smart cover.  The weight gain from this little computer is negligible.<br />2.  My former MB Pro had 8 GB of memory and I was concerned that this one only had 4GB. The updated processor and the SSD drive make the new computer significantly faster.<br />3.  The keyboard is full-size and helps me stay focused on the screen, where my work is taking place.<br />4. The display itself, though small, is just enough workspace for the word-crunching that I do.<br /><br />For those who are considering a migration from windows, imagine life without the &#34;blue screen of death.&#34;  Think about the ease of document management between your laptop and those other i-devices you probably already have.  When people ask me today why I love a particular Apple product,  I usually say, &#34;It just works!&#34;  Try one and see.",0.6799999999999999,,0.1421362863327149,,iPhone

"I bought it because I went through 2 different wireless routers (2Wire and Netgear) that had awful performance. They would function well with 1-2 computers connected, but would choke with 3+ devices. After looking for every possible explanation (I thought it couldn't have been that both brand routers are at fault), I figured I'll try a trusted brand like Apple.<br /><br />The differce is significant. I'm connecting 3 laptops and an iPhone to the router and I have no slow-downs or lost connections (as was before Apple Airport express). Printer over the network works flawelessly - I just connected it to the router and no set-up was necessary for my MacBook. For the windows machine I followed simple instructions I found on google to add the printer over the network for Airport Express.<br /><br />The only negative comment is that setting up the Airport Express itself was not absolutely trivial. I had to answer a few questions during the set-up regarding whether I have a bridge modem or a PPPoE connection, or something to that extent. With some educated guesses, and after a few failed attempts I got the questions right and the router was online. So there's a bit to say regarding simplicity of set-up (further documentation for those who are not familiar with home network set-ups would help a lot).<br /><br />But that's still under 1 hour worth of effort total, and now I don't touch the thing anymore, and it functions perfectly.

"It seems like the iPods have been around forever, and until now I resisted getting one because I really didn't think I'd use it very much. I don't carry a music player around with me, or use one at the gym, etc., so I felt I had no need for one. But, I have around 150 CDs, and probably 90% of them sit in my house unplayed, because I play CDs mostly in my car, and I'm not in the habit of changing them out very much. Well, I finally decided to rip all of the tracks off of ALL my CDs, and I'm going to put them all on my new 64GB iPod. I'll use the MP3 jack in my car and have access to my entire collection at my fingertips, while I drive. I'm also getting Apple tv, and I'll stream music from my iPod, wirelessly, to my tv with a surround sound system.

"Hey Everyone,<br />I finally ordered my Mid 2011 Mac Mini from Amazon :)<br />I also bought all the accessories over the last few months, like Apple Wireless Keyboard, Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, HDMI cable and of course the Macbook Air External Superdrive :)<br />I also bought the LG 23 inch LED 1080p Monitor, so finally I got the last ingredient of this Magic Computing.<br />I also installed the Corsair 8GB of DDR3 RAM, and all I can say, is that I never knew what Apple was really about until today.<br />I have my iPhone 4 and iPad 2, but this computer is so smooth and fast, that my 4 year old Dell XPS desktop has been packed up and is sitting in my closet lol<br />This Mac Mini is the best little computer I have ever used, and I am in love with Apple all over again :)<br />If you want a Mac on a budget, don't hesitate one bit, but buy this Mac Mini, you won't be disappointed, I guarantee you :)<br />Also if you think that the Intel HD 3000 graphics of this computer is not good enough, then you better think again, because the graphics are super clear and crisp. Awesome color, and pictures plus video editing looks spectacular. Don't forget to upgrade the RAM to 8GB though, because with the 2GB the computer was sure sluggish lol. I actually can barely wait until I get the Apple 27 inch Display for this Mac Mini, and then via Thunderbolt it will be heaven thats for sure.<br />I also noticed that my audio has changed and is so much better then on the Dell XPS. Apple is sure the best every way you look at it :)<br /><br />I cannot say anything bad about this little monster, but upgrade the RAM to 8GB, its so worth it :)<br />I honestly don't think that the $799 Mac Mini is worth the extra $200 for a slightly faster CPU and a dedicated ATI GPU. This Intel HD 3000 has really surprised me, because I remember all those old integrated graphics from the 90's and 2000's, so this puppy is superb!!!!!<br /><br />Don't wait and get this Mac Mini, and you will be in heaven just like I am right now as I am writing this review :)<br />Go Buy One Now!!!

"I am on the third pair now, thank God for the 2 year guarantee.<br />Straight to the point.<br />- Sound is amazing when the noise canceling is active when is not sound exactly like regular Airpods.<br />- Noise cancellation is fantastic, such a weird feeling the first couple of weeks  before you get use to it.<br />- They look awesome and stay in my ears pretty good.<br />- Battery is pretty good too but i wouldn't mind for an extra hour.<br />So .... what is the problem??? Let me start.<br />After 3 months the right ear piece start making crackling sound when noise cancellation is on and you cough or talk loud, slightly noticeable at the begging but it gets worse and worse.<br />So I replace it and all was fine. Then the left start doing the same thing. Replaced it again.<br />Pretty happy for my new Airpods Pro again thinking that My first pair was faulty.<br />WRONG.... Again the same story.<br />Now I am on the third pair and I know it is going to happen again. If you check the forums there are thousands of people having the same problem.<br />Like I said they work flawlessly with my iPhone, iWatch and my mac, but only for 3-4 months.<br />I am very disappointed with that product but I was lucky to listen the guy at the apple store and get the protection plan.<br />Something else. the problem disappear if you use them with out the noise cancellation but then why you just don't get the not Pro ones.<br />If you get them ... GET THE PROTECTION PLAN.",0.96,,0.16020817417876243,,iPhone

"I purchased these the day they came out. I had used the LG Tone pros for years (around the neck) but decided to give these a try. I liked the idea of the original Air Pod but hated the hard plastic buds.<br /><br />I returned them a day after buying them because I couldn‚Äôt get a good fit. I don‚Äôt have abnormally large ear canals but they were just uncomfortable. To me, $250 for poor fitment was unacceptable. The snap on design of the bud meant aftermarket tips were unlikely. But I absolutely loved them other than that. The noise cancelling is as good if not better than my Bose QC35s and the bass is the best I‚Äôve found in an ear bud. The controls are a little finicky just because these are shorter than the original air pod. They pair instantly to the iPhone with little effort. The sound is amazing and the transparency mode makes it feel like you‚Äôre not even wearing them!  In ‚Äúoff‚Äù they block out a lot of background noise but you need a good seal for the noise cancelling to work well. Ultimately I ended up buying them again because of the sound quality.<br /><br />Battery life was a concern for me. Off brand ear buds offer much better battery life but they‚Äôre bulkier. The battery life is decent on these. I tend to pop them in and remove them when not in use so they‚Äôre always getting a good charge in the case.<br /><br />I actually use them for sleeping. I have a hard time getting to sleep and hear everything around me. I purchased the Bose Sleep buds a few months back but they were uncomfortable for a side sleeper (plus they were recalled).  These are so small I can‚Äôt even feel them in my ear when laying down. I turn on noise cancelling and play a white noise soundtrack such as Airplane Cabin noise or a outdoor sound. I usually wake up to find them somewhere in my bed (thank god for gps tracking).<br /><br />The price tag is definitely steep but all Apple products suffer from that. But they‚Äôre worth the price for the quality. I ended up playing with all the silicone tips before I found one that fit right. Although all 3 tips passed the ‚Äúear fitment test‚Äù according to my phone. There are memory foam tips available on other sites. As with any silicone tipped ear bud, as you sweat, they tend to loosen up. But I have not had them fall out.",0.96,,0.1156172839506173,,iPhone

"The quality of the sound is fantastic . . . when they actually work.  After using for a week or so, eventually either the left or the right ear does not work.  Troubleshooting with Apple recommendations will sometimes solve the problem, but this is only after days of working on them.  Eventually, after resetting them, they stop connecting to my phone at all.  I have made several phone calls to Apple and ultimately have had to ship them back to Apple.  I have gone through that process twice already and am getting ready to ship them back a third time.  I could understand if I was using an old phone or one that is not compatible, but it is an iPhone 12.  And the AirPod Pros are not even a year old.  Customer service will not replace the ear pieces or the case, but require I either make an appointment to take them to an Apple store (the closest being about 1.5 hours away) or mail them back.  Because I don't have 4 hours to spare, I send them back.  Each time this happens, I am without useful earphones for at least 2 weeks.  And there are plenty of times I am unable to use them for days until I actually manage to get them to work on my own without losing connectivity to my phone entirely.  So the set I bought is a bad product, but customer service from Apple is horrible.",0.96,,-0.004761904761904749,,iPhone

"This is only day 2 of my apple smart watch. So far the capacity of the series 7 far out weighs the fitbit versa 2 accept it doesn't seem to collect as much sleep data as the fitbit did. I have insomnia and liked seeing when I got a good nights sleep but overall this watch has a lot more to offer. I am new to it so I will most likely come back to modify this review. As usual the setup was pretty intuitive. Remember if you are looking for data collected to look in the Apple Health App that comes with your iphone. I love tekky stuff so this watch will keep me busy for a while. I paid almost 3 times as much for the Apple watch as I did my versa 2 so I am expecting a lot more. I may adjust the star ratings as I become more aquanted with the watch. I was a little disappointed in the charging cable not including the power adaptor. It has a magnetic end that attaches to the watch, which is nice because if you use a screen protector you won't have to  remove it to charge the watch. The other end however is a type-C and I had  no power adaptors with a type-C. I was able to  charge it with my tablet and I also have a couple of portable power supplies that have type-C so I am good until my new power adaptor arrives. I was reading in a forum and another person complained about the same thing and someone pointed out that it is our responsibilty to find out what's in the box. That's true but for that price I still think you should get one with the watch. Apple claims it's to help the enviornment. Power adaptors sometimes get legs and walk away on there own so I think it best to provide one.",0.96,,0.23045353084415585,,iPhone

"I've had these for about a month now, and I can give the following review with confidence: These are great for the average person. They're very comfortable, stay in well for a jog, and the sound quality and features are all great. Pairing and connectivity to the iPhone is smooth, as expected. The fit is excellent, I think it was nice touch including different sizes of ear gummies. I personally use the smallest ones. You can wear them pretty much all day without discomfort.<br />The active noise cancellation -- They work, but they're not perfect. This features blocks out every day noises pretty well, and in conjunction with the audio from whatever you're listening to I'd say they drown out outside noises very well; I wouldn't go as far as to call it ""noise cancelling"" though. I'd say half the time they actually completely cancel noises, and the other half they'll muffle noises enough to make it easy for you to ignore and focus on whatever you're listening to. Overall, they're excellent. I do not consider myself an audiophile. As an average user, I'd say I am beyond happy with the results.<br />The transparency mode -- I think this is underrated. It is amazing for when you're goin on jogs, as it allows you to enjoy your music while still being aware of your surroundings. I also enjoy that because you can hear yourself better, you speak at a more reasonable volume on the phone. I find myself speaking regularly instead of shouting during phone calls because I can tell that I'm speaking at a normal volume. I'm not sure if anybody else feels the need to talk louder with headphones / earphones in because their own voice is muffled, and they don't think they're speaking loud enough...but if you are, I hope you can relate to this tangent.<br />The mic -- Good enough. I haven't been told that I sounded weird over the phone. No complaints on clarity of my speech either.<br /><br />Overall, great headphones. Comfortable, definitely an upgrade from the first gens I had. The features are great for an average user; I use both the transparency and noise cancellation modes all the time. Would definitely recommend it for everyday use. If you do extreme work outs or are an audiophile, maybe you won't enjoy these as much.",0.96,,0.22432748538011693,,iPhone

"So, as I said in the title. I have had bluetooth earphones before, but the sound quality always seemed better with wired phones instead of bluetooth. But, I found these on sale and thought I'd give them a try. If I didn't like them I'd just return them.<br /><br />Man, was I wrong. These are better than any wired noise cancellation earphones I've ever had.<br /><br />The integration between my iPhone and iPad is awesome. I can switch between the iPad and the iPhone seamlessly. And the ability to switch between noise cancellation and non noise cancellation with the earphones themselves is a great added benefit. If I want to have noise cancellation I can just tap the right earphone and I hear almost nothing. If I want to be able to talk to people or hear what is going on around me I can also just tap again and it switches to non noise cancellation.<br /><br />This is a game changer, for me, for ear phones.<br /><br />Also, on charging.... The charging unit holds a good amount of charge. I was on a flight recently and the earphones went down to 5%. I put them in the charging case and after 5 mins of charging I had another hour of earphone use. Got me to my destination.<br /><br />The charging case does incredibly well at charging these super fast.<br /><br />I can't find a single complaint.",0.96,,0.27012138188608775,,iPhone
"I love everything about this iPad especially the color. It was easy to sync all of the items from the old iPad to this one. The only issue is that there is a particular program on the computer to download in order to sync the music and it is not iTunes. Someone had mentioned it on the Apple Website.<br /><br />However, I love this anyway. The new unlocking is easy when you just use the touch ID instead of using a passcode. It has a bigger hard drive, so I am able to access programs better. It has good sound, the HDR camera looks better, and, well, what more can I say?<br /><br />The downside to this is when first getting it, there may be a few software updates and the user has to make sure they have the latest version of ITunes. Sometimes the new software will give the Apple products issues, but I have not run into any of these problems with this iPad.<br /><br />This iPad had somewhat replaced the laptop due to its portability and quickness in getting Wi-Fi signals. Have not experimented to add it to cell phone plan but will look into that more.

"From a hardware point of view, the 4th Gen touch is a nicely thought out device that combines a capable media player with good PDA functionality. Issues on the hardware side are minor: as others have noted, the camera is merely bearable and, while slim and shiny look good, they are also hard to hold and easy to drop.<br /><br />But good hardware needs software. After installing iTunes 10 on my very quick Windows 7 machine, initial sync with MS Outlook contacts and calendar was seamless - Ironically you can't do this with MS's own Zune. Then I added my music collection. You probably think a 64GB media player would be capable of syncing about 2000 music tracks. Silly goose - not with iTunes. After about 24 hours of `determining gapless playback information' with no end in sight, no music had been synced - not a single track. I've uninstalled, reinstalled, and disabled just about every option I can find - yet it still takes 3 to 5 minutes just to open a menu or select a view in iTunes. I will experiment with iTunes alternatives - let the weeks of trouble shooting begin.",0.9,,0.15582706766917293,,iPhone

I purchased at my local Verizon store.  Build quality and overall feel of the device is great.  I would definitely reccommend getting a case as soon as possible, as I am always nervous about accidental drops with Apple's products (they are not very ""ruggedized"").<br /><br />The iPad this model it at this time it is fast and seems to be able to do everything I need with it.  I wouldn't go so far as to say it will 100% replace a PC or a Mac Laptop for ALL needs, as Apple advertises, but it is darn close.<br /><br />I have a keyboard case that I purchased with the Ipad and that adds $100 or so to the price.<br /><br />Having the LTE modem built in is wonderful.  I am able to get a good signal in most all of the buildings where I work.<br /><br />Having the integration across devices that Apple offers with all of their products is convenient.<br /><br />I recently had to contact Apple support and they stayed with me on the chat line until my issue was resolved.<br /><br />Compared to my older iPad devices this particular model at this time it is super fast.<br /><br />It is also nice with Apple devices to not be required to re-purchase old software that I purchased for older devices.<br /><br />At this time I have no regrets about the purchase of this particular model and I am overall very pleased with the experience.",0.9400000000000001,,0.2361111111111111,,iPhone
"First want to start by disclosing that I rated this 2 stars because it came with scratches.  When you pay so much for a product you expect to receive it brand new in top quality.  I was disappointed it wasn't that.  But I didn't return it because functionally, these bad boys are freaking amazing.  The noise cancelling gets me in a hyper focus state.  It's an awesome feeling when it wraps you into a noise insulated reality.  Although it is a significant difference, it does not block all the noise.  It does a great job on blocking out ""noise"" but higher pitch sounds still come through.  The transparency mode is very useful too. When you turn these features ""off"" there is a noticeable difference between transparency and off.  But what I love most about this product is its vertical integration with other apple products.  Take an earbud off one ear and it pauses what was playing.  Put it back in the ear, and it resumes what it was playing.  Connected to your iPhone but want to broadcast sound from your Mac? Just click on the speaker icon on the top toolbar and select AirPods.

"LOVE IT<br /><br />The former 'Gangsta Rapper' from Compton has made a great effort to make it feel like a premium experience out of the box. The box itself is really nice. There are 2 large magnets built into the sides to help secure the box when not in use. The very plastic that holds the manual feels premium as opposed to the cheap clear plastic you typically get.<br /><br />My first impression looking at the earbud was wow. It does indeed appear to be precision milled and painted. I don't know how long that blue paint will last, but it look damn good out the box.<br /><br />The silicon ear buds feel different than my Sony's. They feel softer and more delicate. They feel more upscale. The end of the plug that goes into my iPhone is made of solid metal. I have never seen a pair of headphones that made the end of the plug a solid metal. Very nice touch.<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about the cord. It is very thin. I guess svelte would be a good way to describe it. I didn't know cords even came that thin. I guess if it helps reduce vibration noise transfer while you are jogging that could be a plus (I walked a mile from the bus stop to my house and there wasn't any issue with vibration noise).<br /><br />The metal plug end, cord, and silicon ear buds all have a sort of matte-like finish (they are not shiny) which gives a nice overall sense of refinement and quality.<br /><br />I love the mic/sound controls by the left ear bud. I am not used to having volume controls so close to my mouth, but I guess the mic has to be close so that's why they put it there. The controls are actually easier to operate than I thought. They are ingeniously designed so that if you grab the cord and simply push, you won't be accidentally pushing the side of the control, rather the controls themselves.<br /><br />I have accidentally hit the Play/Pause button several times on accident. Maybe it's because I am not used to the control yet. It is extremely handy because it is such a pain to pull my iPhone out just to adjust the volume. I have the iPhone 5 and I dislike very much having to adjust the controls because they are hard to figure out. The remote control allows me to bypass the manual buttons on the iPhone, yes!<br /><br />Have not tried the mic yet, I have no idea how well it works, sorry.<br /><br />I purchased this from the airport which is normally a huge no-no for me since their prices are always higher. The price on Amazon was $10 cheaper, but the guy at the store opened the box for me to try them on and I figured that gesture deserved to be rewarded. Got some xmas money from the parents so I figured what the hell?<br /><br />Reviews on this site are encouraging. Everyone seems to have the 2 month bug, haha. Guess I'll see what happens after a couple.<br />I will update this review (if I remember) and report back on reliability. I did keep the receipt just in case I need to do something (hopefully I won't have to).<br /><br />Oh, what's a review about headphones without talking about sound quality???<br /><br />It's very good. Highs are very good, pretty clear. Not the clearest I've ever heard, but very nice (by the way, I own a pair of Grado's who make professional quality headphones so that's my frame of reference, not a pair of $10 JVC's). I think the mids are where these cans shine the most. They are solid. Vocals and instrumentals sound very good. Bass is there but lacks impact. I was listening to 6'7' by Lil Wayne (lots of bass) and the bass is there but I don't feel it like I did with my old Sony's (my Sony's were the bomb).<br /><br />I think the magnet Beats is using is high quality but very small, or perhaps it is a driver that is designed to give better high frequency output? A larger magnet would create a bigger impact but might impede higher frequency reproduction.<br /><br />This product reminds me very much of Apple. Beats has obviously made very serious attempt to give their customers a premium experience. I have purchased headphones in the $100 range in the past, and I've never received the small touches in their products that Beats has given me. I really appreciate it.<br /><br />I have to say something about the case. I love it. There's some sort of thick metal or wire that holds it shut really tight. I have to wedge my finger in there a bit and squeeze the sides to open it up. The case itself feels like vinyl, again, it feels like a quality material. If I didn't know any better and I saw someone with these headphones next to me (and case) I would be jealous.<br /><br />***Update***<br /><br />I've been listening to these cans for the last couple days solid. There's something about these headphones that invite me to want to use them. The drivers have actually loosened up a bit and bass is a just a tad fuller and just a teensy bit deeper and maybe even a teensy bit louder. Mids and highs are still the strong points. These headphones are consistent with the sound quality of other Beats models. I think it's the clarity that stands out the most.<br /><br />Beats sound is unlike any other I've heard. With Sony I have an idea of what it's going to sound like before I even put it on. Same goes for Panasonic and others. The tonalities and strengths of Beats is very different from other makes. With Bose headphones the mids and highs are also strengths. But with Bose, their highs are really super. It's their lows and mid-bass that tend to get a bit muddied and boomy. With Beats, it feels as if every bit of spectrum has been tinkered with to try to make a great sound but I can tell it's bit tinkered with. It sounds good, but I can tell it's been enhanced. The end product sounds very polished, but there's something alluring about pure sound that comes out raw as well. With Bose speakers the highs tend to sound a bit more honest which is something I really like about them.<br /><br />Getting away from sound quality, these headphones feel like the Cadillacs of the in-ear headphone world. Just holding the evenly lengthened cord (Sony's are uneven which is annoying) is something else. It feels like rubber, even though it's probably not. Grabbing that metal end piece and plugging it into my iPhone feels inviting. Holding onto the solid precision machined outer ear piece feels premium and sliding the super smooth, delicate silicon earbuds into my ear complete the experience. Being able to control the volume on the cord itself makes these more usable than my other headphones.<br /><br />***Update Jan 6, 2015***<br /><br />The cord that these come with are anti-tangle which I REALLY appreciate. When I run there is some sound transferred from the cord into your ear. Knowing this, I would still buy these again. It's not that big a deal to me.<br /><br />***Update 4-1-15***<br /><br />Still working. Most annoying thing is the cord is very grippy. If my hand or arm slides down and touches the cord anywhere, it pulls on the earphone. Very annoying. Still loving my headphones though.",0.8400000000000001,,0.16925606837606827,,iPhone

"I'm about two weeks into my new Airpods Pro and it's time to drop some comments.  For context I'm coming from a $30 pair of Anker (wired) Bluetooth headphones that have served me well for 5+ years (and still work by the way), and Bose QC35 II headphones.  I've also spent an interesting amount of time with Bose QC30 headphones which would be more physically on par with the Airpods Pro.<br /><br />== Noise Cancellation==<br />Noise cancellation in true wireless format  are the only reasons I was willing to chunk down $250 (an outrageous price even by Bose standards) for a pair of headphones.  I wanted something I could wear at the gym or on travel.  Note for those of you who don't get the ""true wireless"" marketing term (I didn't and had to look it up), it simply means Bluetooth headphones that don't  have a wire between the two ear buds.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly my QC 35 IIs still outperform Airpods Pro *but* my QC35s have huge physical ear pieces to block out more sound so this isn't entirely fair.  The QC30s are more of an earbud style and compared to Airpods Pro I'd say the two are on par when it comes to noise cancellation.  Maybe a slight edge to the QC30s.<br /><br />Where my Bose headphones shine is they switch between noise cancelling and no noise cancelling flawlessly, over and over.  My Airpods behave erratically switching between modes even once.  When switching between noise cancellation and transparent modes I've had the Airpods become unresponsive to click commands, lose connection in one ear, had the ear buds get out of sync, had noise cancellation in one ear and not the other, and a host of other issues.  I usually have to put the buds back in the case and let them sit for a minute or two to reset them.<br /><br />== Sound Quality ==<br />We buy ear buds to listen to stuff.  I listen to audio books, and am a Spotify junkie!  Also serving the occasional phone call.  I like a wide spread of music but mainly hang in the trance, electronica, rock, and metal categories.  The sound stage (that is, separation of instruments - making it so each instrument has a distinct position in your perceived space) is excellent!  Again not quite as good as my QC35s but darn close.  My Anker headphones don't even compete.<br /><br />I think most electronica and low end bass lovers will be disappointed with the Airpods.  Being physically small makes it hard to do huge bass as it is, and I feel the EQ (not adjustable outside of Spotify) is tuned to focus more on the mid and high range.  Regardless, I was pretty disappointed at first, but I've adjusted a bit and am happy enough with the bass end now.  Mid and high range are superb!  I generally used a Rock EQ profile in Spotify's settings with my Anker buds and Bose headsets.  I decided the ""Flat"" setting is better with my Airpods.  I will say that the bass end is very distinct on Airpods (like you can actually pick out the bass guitar!) and that crisp stage separation may be what ruins the generally smeared bass end of a lot of electronica aside from less physical thump.<br /><br />Audio books are not a problem at all, and so far phone calls seems good too.<br /><br />== Form Factor ==<br />Excellent!  Very comfortable, fit snugly, and I have yet to even  have an ear bud budget while running, cycling, rowing, etc.<br /> These buds are really light and it's easy to forget they're in you ears!  So tiny they're a little hard to deal with getting them in and out of their case.<br /><br />Apple provides three sizes of earpiece.  They are made of soft comfortable material.  I found I needed the large size.  Getting the ear piece off can be a little tricky - they snap on like little Lego bricks, and you have to pull on them until they pop off.  I was afraid i was going to tear them trying to get them off, but they seem to be pretty durable.  Be advised that there is a ""check fit"" option on your iPhone to help you find the right size.  Got into Bluetooth settings, and click the info button next to your Airpods to get to the Airpod settings.<br /><br />== Battery Life ==<br />I don't have these in all day but I'd say the specs Apple provides are pretty close.  Maybe a little low.  I've gone 3-4 hours at a time without running out of juice. I usually listen at mid level volumes so if you crank it you may have a different experience.<br /><br />== Connectivity ==<br />CRAZY CRAZY CRAZY amazing!  Being an Apple product these paired up with my iPhone just by opening the case and holding my phone near.  That's not the amazing part.  The amazing part is the range!  My Anker buds dropped out a lot at the gym if I was doing an exercise where my body effectively wrapped my phone and blocked the signal.  I could get maybe 30-40 feet if I had a clear line of site.  I forgot my phone in a stretching area and started a walk around an indoor track.  I must've made it 100 feet through walls, people, and gym equipment before my Airpods dropped out even a little.  I know a lot of this is Bluetooth 5 and not entirely unique to Airpods but I have to say I'm impressed!<br /><br />== Surprise Feature ==<br />I wasn't particularly interested in more than the noise cancellation and small form factor.  Sound quality is important to me but not the main driver here.  While the spec sheet calls it out (and it wasn't really a surprise) I am extremely surprised by how much I like the in-ear detection feature.  It's really nice to be able to pop out a bud, have your music pause and have a conversation then put the bud back in and pick up again.  Pretty slick!  Also imperative since turning noise cancellation on and off causes problems and you have to take a bud out to talk.<br /><br />== Other Buggy Stuff ==<br />Apart from the things I've listed in the Noise Cancellation section, I've had a lot of other weird behavior.  Once I pulled the buds right out of the case and put them in my ears and  had one bud fail to connect.  Sometimes if I  put the buds in the case with noise cancellation on and then put the buds back in later they will come on without noise cancellation and won't let me switch noise cancellation back on (through any method including settings on my iPhone).<br /><br />This is incredibly disappointing at this price tag let alone for an Apple product.  Bose charges the same money but they are rock solid when it comes to the prime use cases.  In general I feel like Apple's quality continues to degrade with every release.  I get bugs are part of software (it's what I do for a living) but you don't release a product with major and obvious bugs in the primary use case of the product.  Especially at this price point!  My Anker buds were $30, have lasted me years, and have worked flawlessly.  Yea they're simpler functionality, but still.<br /><br />== Bottom Line ==<br />In the hopes of a software update to fix all the weird issues, I am overall a fan and very pleased!  The noise cancellation, sound quality, and battery life are not state of the art, but come together in a perfect form factor and make it happen for me.  I dinged a star for sound quality (need a little more bass end), and the general buggy state of the product.  My only other wish is these were in the $150 range.  That $250 is really hard to swallow, especially when things don't work flawlessly.  But I expect to be gouged by Apple so I go in knowing you're going to over pay on the expectation you're going to get a flawless top quality product.  Didn't quite pan out this go.  Software updates may change that.",0.96,,0.13490395324287938,,iPhone

"First let me just burst the ‚Äúare these authentic or fake‚Äù question bubble. These are 100% Apple. These are shipped by and sold by Amazon. These type items will always be legit. Buying from a third party might be a risk though. I myself would never buy a hot expensive item like this from a third party unless I had total confidence in the seller. All that said, I must say I have had these two days since until this writing and these are awesome!  I owned a pair of first generation iPods and recently gave them to my daughter which she loves. So I needed to replace them and this was a great decision. The noise cancellation is amazing. I have never had that in earphones or ear buds before. I was shocked what happens when you turn that own. I have a toy poodle that barks at every UPS and Fedx truck as well as the mail man. With the noise cancellation on, all I see is his mouth moving and his head going back haha. No sound which is nice when I don‚Äôt want to hear him lol. Now I have had earphones that sound better but remember what you are buying the for. The convenience of no wires mostly I bet. Yes the sound is very important and these will satisfy. Don‚Äôt expect them to blow your ear drums out but they have plenty of bass and volumn if you don‚Äôt have to have the best out there. I will sacrifice some for the quality of these as well as the comfort.

It will break when you drop it from a fair height and everyone knows that. With the new iPod 5 out, yes, there will be a few apps that won't work with it, but there is absolutely no use whining about it. There are plenty of games and apps that do work, and so what if it crashes to the home screen sometimes?

"My fitness tracker was about 7 years old, and they didn't make that one anymore.  And it was getting flaky.  So it was time for a new watch!<br /><br />I went for the 41mm smaller one, because I do have smaller wrists, and I don't like a large clunky watch.  This one is perfectly sized for me.  I would have liked the bigger screen, but I wouldn't have wanted to wear it, so this was the one.<br /><br />Setup took longer than I expected because I had to update my iPhone to get things to work.  Then setup of the watch also took quite a while.  After setting it up, I wasn't that impressed.  Yes, it was comfortable, but it seemed like just a watch.  That only lasted a day or two.  Now I just love this thing.<br /><br />I definitely messed around with it for a few days until I got it set up like I wanted it.  It took me a while to find a face that felt natural, along with the ""complications"" on it I liked.  Just FYI: Complications are what apple calls the little widgets available right from the watch face.  Stuff like weather, times, the fitness app...  And once you get them how you want to work with them, they are handy.<br /><br />I turned on all the sleep tracking, and I liked that.  It told me my respiration rate and heart rate throughout the night.  And it told me when I fell asleep and woke up.  Overall I like the implementation of it.<br /><br />Chasing the rings - Hey, this was cool.  I setup the fitness goals on the watch, and one day I just took a walk in the woods.  10 minutes in my watch buzzed and said ""Hey, it looks like you're working out"" and asked me what I was doing.  It seemed to know I was walking, and was asking if it was indoors or outdoors.  I responded and continued my walk in the woods.  At the end of my walk the watch gave me all the statistics of it, like my heartbeat rate, how far I walked, how long I was walking, really just the details.  I'm a bit of a nerd, and I thought it was awesome.  I also closed my green ring for the day.  I like it.<br /><br />It's an expensive watch, but it is also a very cool watch.  So far I like it a lot.<br /><br />Durability - ?  My last watch lasted 7 years.  Will this one?  I don't know.  Only time can tell that.

"I purchased a Mac Mini to serve as a home computer. I like Apple products and for compatibility with my MBP, iPhone, iPad, and wife's iPod Touch, I felt a Mac Mini would suit the rest well.<br /><br />Overall happy with it. One major oversight was the default 2GB of RAM. Multitasking is a pain, even with simply surfing the web and playing music. With Firefox and iTunes open, a majority of the RAM is immediately used up, causing the Mini to run sluggishly.<br /><br />I ordered 8GB of RAM, which should arrive tomorrow and that will fix how slowly the Mini runs. I recommend a MINIMUM of 4GB of RAM. 2GB is way too little. Do not waste your money upgrading to 4GB from Apple! It's at least 50% cheaper to buy and install the RAM yourself.

"Battery on the two Apple Ipod Touch 4g 64gb(s) that I have used have been horrendous. I say two because the first unit I was sold at the Apple Store in downtown Philadelphia was replaced by another unit- that had exactly the same battery issues. Battery issues are these. The first day you have the Ipod Touch 4g 64gb it seemed fine. But I bought it while I was at work (on a break) and got it turned on there at the Apple Store. So it just gets turned on and ends up in my pocket as i go back to work. Next day- it has my apps on it and songs and a few videos and ebooks. But it doesn't hold the all night charge all day. Just a few hours and by day two- it has me stressing that it is going to have power at the end of my day. I don't mean from a day of use either- I mean a day in my pocket. I'm a security guard- so the Ipod Touch 4g 64 is OFF- while in my pocket all day. The only time I take it out of my pocket (and ON)is during the two breaks that I have during the day and my lunch. So during my workday- I get almost exactly 1 hours actual use from my brand new Apple Ipod Touch 4g 64gb- where it is actually ON- and the rest of my day it is OFF in my pocket! But at the end of my day- it won't even turn on because it is out of POWER.<br />You shouldn't have to pay the $430.00 cash that I paid to be stressed out worrying if your BRAND NEW IPOD TOUCH 4g 64gb is going to work.<br />I have an appointment with the Apple Store this coming Tuesday- they will blah blah blah me- and try and foist a third IPOD TOUCH 4G 64gb on me I bet- but I'm getting my money back.<br />It is a shame, though. It is truly amazing when it works- the most advanced and wonderful piece of electronics that I have ever owned- but I didn't ask to be a beta tester. When I paid my $430.00 dollars I thought they should have worked out the kinks- and expected just the awesome- Apple robbed me of my wonderful first APPLE Purchase. And have left me leery of buying any of their products ever again.<br />My Apple Ipod Touch 4g 64gb - the one I originally bought and the replacement for it-both sucked battery-wise).<br />Wait to buy this product- it's not ready for primetime.<br />I purchased the iPod Touch 4g 64gb for 399.00 plus 31.92 tax total of 430.92<br />Your telling me that the normal way of charging the thing isnt- the USB that Apple GAVE ME? (that charges 100%)<br />but that I should purchase ""some other gadget"" for more money? when the way apple sold it to me doesn't work?<br /><br />UMMM No!<br /><br />I'm a (or I was) first time Apple product user with this product.<br />Did I mention it was a replacement cuz the first one was a mess, too?<br />I need to be the one??? to figure out how to keep their brand new gadget running? Me the one to jump thru hoops and such? Do this try that blah blah blah??<br />No- my friend.<br />I'm Not the 430 dollar ""paying"" beta tester.<br />I returned the replacement- and got a chit for 430 dollars and their solemn promise to send me a check at some time in the future.<br />Bear in mind I paid them cash money- greenbacks/ USA currency.<br />I didn't want a check- I wanted what I GAVE THEM CASH!!!!!<br />It's 4 days later i have no iPod touch 4g 64gb and no money either.<br />Who knew they were such a scumbag company.<br />I'll ""probably"" get my money back soon?

"My 2-star review is not with the air pods or Apple at all. The air pods are stellar. My poor review is for the sellers of this product who have it advertised as ‚Äúnew‚Äù and never used. When I opened the box the first thing I noticed was that there were only 2 sets of ear cushions when Apple clearly states that they come with 3 different sized (S, M, L). The missing set I could overlook & not make a big deal of. But the real kicker & hard core evidence that the ‚Äúnew‚Äù airpod pros that I had purchased were previously owned by another Apple customer was this ‚Ä¶.. when I first connected them to my iPhone they came up as ‚ÄúAngie‚Äôs Air Pod Pros!‚Äù My name couldn‚Äôt be further from Angie. I‚Äôm not sure who Angie is, but if I had to render a guess I‚Äôm going to bet that the missing ear cushion set is somewhere in one of Angie‚Äôs junk drawers in her kitchen.

These ARE NOT the best sounding headphones. Not even close. But they are still really good. They are awesome if you are in the apple ecosystem. iPhone iPad MacBook. The noise cancellation.

"I've been using my airpods pro for about a year and a half now. I don't regret buying them. In fact, they're one of the best purchases I've ever made. However if you're thinking about dropping $200 on a pair of headphones, you need to consider a couple of things.<br />First, if you don't have an apple product (specifically an iPhone 7 or later) don't bother. I used an iPhone when I first purchased these, but have since moved to an android platform and my experience with them has gotten drastically worse. They're still usable, but not worth the $200 price point if this is the case<br />Second off, are you doing it for the style? Airpods have a very obvious status to them. If you value that status so much, feel free to pay a premium price for a pair of earbuds that's below the quality they should be.<br />Active Noise Cancelling is adequate. Good enough that when riding a train, you can hear your music and the rumbling is significantly less noticeable. However it's not even comparable to other products in relatively similar price points.<br />Ambient Sound is fantastic. This is where this pair really shines. I forget I have earbuds in sometimes in lectures. Putting on instrumental music with transparency mode on makes it seem like your life has background music. While other headphones are able to offer similar quality at this point, these earbuds still keep up well with the competition in this regard.<br />Finally, we have the most important aspect: sound quality. eh. Not bad, but not great by any stretch of the word. Bass is lacking among about every other aspect.<br />Overall, they're fine. They do their job. I just prefer the other options. The Sony WF-1000XM4's and XM3's both have fantastic sound quality and ANC for relatively similar prices. Bose also had excellent quality earbuds. As does Jabra. If these didn't have an Apple logo on them they would have faded to the background long ago.",0.96,,0.17904761904761907,,iPhone
"I was worried about the comments saying this is fake but that definitely wasn't the case (or I might just be one of the lucky customers). The product is legit and came in complete package. I live outside the US at it took about 3 weeks before I got it (used forwarder). Really nice sound but I honestly do not see any difference using the standard earpods and the airpods pro, except that the latter has noise cancellation. Battery life is okay but this is fairly new so I can't say. Maybe it will depend on your usage. My iPhone XR is already 3 years old and the battery is still at 83%. Will probably replace phone when it reaches its 5 years mark.",0.96,,0.10757575757575759,,iPhone
"I rarely write reviews, but I‚Äôm so happy with this purchase I had to make sure I did. I am a pretty big skeptic and saw all the reviews that said they were fake. I almost didn‚Äôt buy them because of that. Boy that would‚Äôve been a mistake! In June we bought some cheapo Bluetooth wireless for like $40. We aren‚Äôt real big spenders if we don‚Äôt have to be. Well, after a month the right ear stopped working. So I went back to read the reviews and write one. Surprise! They aren‚Äôt listed on here anymore.<br /><br />Next I found a pair of Sennheiser on Crutchfield on sale. Some of the reviews mentioned they weren‚Äôt that comfortable and the sound was not as loud as they would like. I ignored the reviews, as this seems to be a well respected brand on their site with other headphone products. You had to twist them into your ear to make the right fit. I tried all the inserts they provided. Just not happy. Crutchfield has an amazing 60 return policy, so I returned them.<br /><br />Since I have a iPhone 13 Pro, decided to bite the bullet and get AirPods. I was figuring on regular ones with a wired charger. Low and behold these are on sale!!! Got them for $180. With the discomfort of the previous ones, I was honestly really hesitant to get these because they have the insert on the end. I love the feel of the normal wired ones, but wanted the superior sound. So I gave them a try. Typical Apple product they paired right up with my phone! That is the one thing I love about Apple/iPhone, such an easy consumer experience. LOVE them! They stay in my ear super well. Sound is AMAZING! Battery life to me is great. I sit at a desk and work at home all day. I love listening to music so I use them all day. If I have a meeting or something, I just throw them in the case to charge and that helps me get through the day. I think once I had to take them out to charge and I just threw my wired ones on for a short while.<br /><br />The sound quality on calls is also awesome! I‚Äôve asked and people said they can‚Äôt even tell that they are headphones. The one thing I hated about the Sennheiser is I had to adjust the ear piece a lot, cause it would feel like it would fall out and the touch control would be activated. So songs would pause, skip, ect. Annoying! On these you pinch the stem, so I can adjust if necessary for fit/comfort without issue. I haven‚Äôt used the voice activation much or noise cancelling. My wife also works from home, so I don‚Äôt want to have that on and want to be able to hear if she says something from another room.<br /><br />One thing I was not expecting that made me die laughing when it happened. I got a text and it read the persons name, their text and the emoji they sent. Something like: ‚ÄòText from Fred Flintstone, did you see the play in the game, exclamation point, laughing emoji, crying emoji‚Äô. After the text it asks if you want to reply. I was outside doing work when this first happened, so I did reply using voice activation. You can turn it off, but found it hilarious.<br /><br />If I‚Äôm really nit picking, the only thing is that they pair to your phone and they ‚Äòbelong‚Äô to you. We went on a camping trip and my wife likes to run and I was worried that she wouldn‚Äôt be able to pair/use them with her iPhone. It works, not a problem, I forget if it was much hassle, but overall that is the only thing I can remotely complain about. Since it worked I have zero issue with it.<br /><br />I‚Äôd buy these again in a heart beat. Anyone that has an iPhone and is in the market it‚Äôs a no brained!",0.96,,0.18385281385281382,,iPhone
"A very solid step up from the second generation which was very good itself. I think Apple made a good choice moving to the AirPods Pro type body design, though without the tips, for the Gen 3. But if you buy these and they just won‚Äôt fit right in your ear, send them back! They‚Äôll probably fit for most but if you‚Äôre one that doesn‚Äôt get a good fit, it‚Äôll likely never be right. Send them back!  Go with AirPods Pro with tips.<br /><br />Recommendation: If you don‚Äôt like tips and the tipless fits your ears, the AirPods 3 is the unequivocal best choice if you own an iPhone. The audio quality, sensor stem touch, quick switch between Apple devices, audio sharing, Siri, FindMy are solid value adds on top of the audio quality. MagSafe charging is a definite plus too.  (Side note: I assume Gen 3 will also be good if you don‚Äôt have iPhone but you don‚Äôt get these added features without iPhone. I don‚Äôt know android phones so non Apple choices My have better features).<br /><br />But if you prefer or need tips, I still give highest recommend to the AirPods Pro for overall performance and features(sound quality is close and Gen 3 beats on some songs). Features listed above plus Conversation boost and noise cancellation, I definitely give a high recommend to the Pro model (important note: Pro Gen 2 is supposedly coming in September 2022.

The wife and I each have Iphones and Apple Watches and I wanted to complete the package so told her I was going to purchase us each a set of Airpod Pros.

She hates the constant droning and cabin noise of flying so I urged her to take my Airpods and just see if she liked them.

The battery life was similar, and they cost just a fraction of the other brand‚Äôs price, however, I tried these AirPods to see if they really made a difference‚Ä¶ to my surprise, they do! Very clear sound, although the bass is not as deep as the other one, the clarity of the music is really good! Even better, the connectivity to my iPhone is automatic, I can text, answer calls, command Siri, etc‚Ä¶ without having to grab my phone to do it; the most important thing for me is the comfort of the AirPods, I can‚Äôt rarely feel them when I wear them, and unfortunately the other ones, there‚Äôs a point where I have to take them out because my ear starts hurting!<br />  The reason why I don‚Äôt give straight 5 stars is because I have issues with some connectivity when I get calls for example, Siri won‚Äôt obey my command to answer without having to press the AirPod nor wants to connect to my AppleTv. Other than that, GREAT!",0.96,,0.2007,,iPhone
It has amazing sound quality for the size that it comes in.<br />When paired with an iPhone you get lots of options that you enjoy such as the spatial sound and the background noise.<br /><br />a bit pricey though,0.96,,0.36,,iPhone
"*A review coming from an Android user.<br />-The sound is okay but not better than the Sony wf1000xm3 that I own.<br />-You cannot see the battery percentage.<br />-They were uncomfortable the first week but my ears got used to them. I have small ears.<br />-Noise cancelling is kinda dissapointing, you can still hear a lot of the background.<br /><br />They are pretty good pair of earbuds for everyday use, perhaps pairing it with an iPhone would be a different story.",0.96,,0.09000000000000001,,iPhone
"Pros:<br />-Sleek design and ""premium"" feel<br />-Seamless connectivity with Apple products, and especially iPhones<br />-Pressure controls are easy to use, and Siri can be summoned without touching the earbuds at all<br />-Decent noise quality (though better can be found at significantly lower price points)<br />-Ambient noise mode works well, and active noise cancelling works decently for a pair of in-ears<br />-Let's be honest, they're AirPods; they make you look cool in front of your friends.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-I tried all three sizes of ear tips and could not find a good fit; I constantly had to push the right AirPod back into my ear. This was the biggest deal-breaker for me.<br />-Consequently, noise cancelling capability suffered; active noise cancelling is only as good as passive noise cancelling (the ""seal"" the earbuds create) allows it to be.<br />-Active noise cancelling, when I turned it on, also noticeably removed some of the bass/low end from music I listened to.<br /><br />When I spend more than $200 on a pair of wireless earbuds, I expect a near-perfect experience, and I feel like I'm justified in that. My experience with the AirPods Pro was far from perfect. They've got a lot of cool bells and whistles, but ultimately they failed me in one of the areas that mattered most: no matter which size ear tips I tried, the darn things wouldn't stay in my ears. It's really annoying to constantly have to push an earbud back into your ear, especially while you're trying to unload the dishwasher or do a cardio workout. And it's definitely not something that anyone should be spending $200 for.<br /><br />Save your money. You can get a pair of wireless earbuds that stay in your ears better AND have better sound quality for a fraction of this price. I'll point you in the direction of the FIIL T1X, a $50 pair of wireless earbuds<br />that have the best sound quality of any I've tried (and I've also tried the Galaxy Buds +) and lodge in my ears like a dream. They don't have all the cool bells and whistles and don't feel as ""premium"" as the AirPods Pro, but they deliver in the areas that, in my opinion, really matter.",0.96,,0.26064993564993566,,iPhone

Seriously tho I‚Äôm extremely sensitive to noise and I easily become very overwhelmed by it and it can drastically impair my mood and sometimes give me panic attacks and I can get very hostile so these truly were a game changer for me by giving me the ability to control and limit all this noise without having to use more noise to do it with.,0.96,,-0.04000000000000001,,iPhone
"I bought this as a gift for my son last December. It stopped connecting to his iPhone recently. I told him to take the Air Pods Pro to Apple Store in Boca Raton, Florida where he was told the item is FAKE. The serial number was in a different format than the one Apple uses.

"I would recommend this product over the knockoffs I've tried. I did some online research for the best dupes and landed on Dangobuds. They were about $100 cheaper, but in my opinion, not at all comparable to a more expensive ear bud. They broke when I dropped them in a slop bucket at the pottery studio. I rejoiced, feeling justified to buy a new pair of Airpods Pro.<br /><br />The ease of pairing the apple brand ear buds with the iPhone is a big plus. Sound quality is really upgraded from the first gen airpod, and the noise cancellation works well even without music playing. I would stick with the reliable brands in this case, if you care at all about sound quality, comfort, etc.",0.96,,0.2786363636363636,,iPhone
"I accidentally left my air pod pro max headphones in the case in my pocket when I threw them in the laundry basket. My wife noticed a knocking sound when the clothes went in the dryer. She found my air pods and removed them.  She set them on the cabinet and assumed they were dead.  About four hours later, she told me so I put them in a container with rice to absorb any moisture.  The next day I tested them and one worked.  A few days later the other one started working. There is no impact from going through the washing machine. I find that amazing.<br /><br />Good sound quality, good noise cancelling, and reasonable battery life.  I had been spoiled to Sennheiser's and Sony's over the ear headphones so I can't call any of the main features great. However, the portability is fantastic and how about that water resistance!  I also likes that my iPhone notifies me if I leave them behind somewhere. I am definitely happy with the purchase.

***UPDATE***. The in line volume control fell apart without even being touch. I took my headphones off at the gym and saw something fall. It was the cover for the volume control.<br /><br />They have good audio but to be honest aren't audiophile quality but I like that I can hear what's going on around me and cars approaching when I'm running outside.

"ipod nano is very nice, small, easy to use, screen is bright.  Only issue is getting used to apple's itunes system over the ease of other systems (zune) when it comes to converting  your music library into itunes the first time.  itunes has some issues unique to its design, e.g. converting wma files to aac, splitting albums into separate albums by guest artists (duets, best of, etc) so this can take some time and patience getting your library setup the first time.  Overall seems worth it, apple offers some products that make sharing that library (apple tv, matching) enticing.",0.9,,0.29333333333333333,,iPhone
"The sound quality is what I expected from an Apple product. I should have upgraded my regalar AirPods to these a long time ago! I kind of wish I had upgraded them. It is definitely a game changer. With the noise isolation, it completely removes background noise. It is like MAGIC!! At the same time, if you turn on the ""Transparency Mode"" you can hear everything clear as day around you as if you didn't have the headphones in -- add in a little music and it is a great setting for when you want to listen to some music while working, but still need to pay attention to whatever is. going on around you. But the moment you want to isolate yourself and block everything and/or everyone around you, turn Isolation mode on. Note that I don't call it noise cancellation, because it is more than that --- it is like turning off the world around you. You don't even have to have music or any sound on to turn this feature on.<br /><br />Easily go from your Mac to your iPhone and even your AppleTV or AppleWatch without having to pair it to every device. Also, the force touch on the stems of the headphones help you toggle between isolation and transparency. Additional controls are there and standard: 1 click on either stem to play/pause, 2 to skip a song, 3 clicks to start the song over and/or go to the previous song. Don't worry about having to press anything to activate Siri -- just invoke Siri by saying ""Hey, Siri"". If you want additional hands free features, you can select to have Siri read your messages when they arrive without having to do anything (you only have the option to set this up when you first set up the AirPods -- you can turn this on from the Notifications Setting on your iPhone at a later time).<br /><br />If you are working from home and need to be able to create a solid work environment without having a door to close behind you, this is a must buy!!

"Bought this laptop for my wife. She switched from Windows 8.1 to Mavericks. There was a bit of a learning curve, which is to be expected, but she took right to her Mac. I'm not a huge fan of the &#34;everything proprietary&#34; approach: it makes the Mac hard to compare to anything else - but she loves it and Apple's pre-installed suite of software (which now includes Works). She also loves the fact that her iPhone and her Mac sync automatically via iCloud.<br />Two possible improvements:<br />a) on our home-brewed battery rundown test, the Macbook 11-inch ran out of juice 5.3 hours into running an .mkv video on a loop, using the VLC Media player. I'm told Quicktime might do better, but Quicktime is not a great player.  This much less than the advertised battery life. In normal browsing and word-processing, the battery life increases to nearly 9 hours. But many of us watch videos on those cross-country flights and 5.3 hours is cutting it close.<br />b) How about a touch screen?

"You can only use PORTRAIT using the front selfie cam.  So just blurred backgrounds for self-portraits/selfies.  Also if you are in PHOTO and swipe to get to SQUARE, PORTRAIT is in-between.  The camera will switch to selfie and stay there, so if you were trying to switch from SQUARE to PHOTO for a better composition, know that you may miss the shot altogether with the delay of switching back.  Better to crop later.  This isn't true for my iPhone 11, so why for the PRO?

I can move around the house doing various activities throughout the day without fear of them falling out or constantly needing to be readjusted. As others have commented, the sound is not audiophile quality, but for ear buds I think the quality is fantastic. The noise cancellation works quite well - I can filter out most of the noise made by my boys in the house while listening to music or watching a movie on my iPhone. Thus far, I'm really impressed. The only bummer is that I have to get out my MacBook Pro to have something to plug them into for charging.

"I was so excited to get the AirPods Pro! They came brand new in all the original packaging and clean, but there was a small dent on the box they were in. The AirPods themselves were in perfect condition.<br /><br />The sound quality is really nice, and I can definitely tell the difference when using the noise cancellation mode. Obviously all noise is not completely drowned out, but it makes it to where the outside noise will not interfere with whatever you‚Äôre listening to which is really convenient. The battery life is pretty good too! They were extremely easy to set up as well. It literally took me less than 5 minutes to set up to my iPhone and I‚Äôve been using them with no issues ever since.<br /><br />The only downside is that the charger base/adapter is not included with the item. So if you do not already have a base that fits the USB-C end then that could be annoying.

"I have moved on to a NANO but the shuffle was my first apple product.  Loved it.  For the price it is quite a great device, especially for workouts.  My first one was run over by a car so I replaced it, even though it could still function with some effort on my part to regulate volume.  It has two weaknesses that led me to the NANO.  The first is capacity.  If you manage your I-tunes account in a way that limits what you store on the device, then capacity can be a non-issue.  But I like lots of different music and have many hundreds of songs and like to play what I want to hear when the mood strikes - not limited by what my device will hold.  So, for me capacity is an issue.  Second, the quality of sound, though good and plenty good for most people, but doesn't meet my very high standards for long term listening.  The NANO is better in that regard; the I-pod touch and I-phone yet another step better (really very very good).  I have the Iphone for work and have some songs on it.  Amazing quality especially if matched with Bose earbuds or a high quality car stereo system.  But I still have my two shuffles and would not hesitate to take one with me if space or risk of loss were a major concern.

"User of AirPods 2, the AirPods Pro are an overall significant improvement.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- similar to the AirPods 1/2, the user experience is seamless with easy initial pairing (for iPhone users), quick connection and very user friendly compare to any other high-end earphones/headphones<br />- much more comfortable to wear than the AirPods 1/2<br />- ANC is top notch and even better than dedicated high-end ANC headphones<br />- physical controls (on the stems) are much better than the AirPods 1/2<br />- realistic and useful transparent mode but not perfect (see cons)<br />- good battery life (for the moment)<br />- quick charging time and wireless charging case<br /><br />Cons:<br />- unnatural call behavior is the biggest con for me and why I still use my AirPods 2 more often. I use the AirPods in majority (especially during the current pandemic crisis) for calls (phone, zoom, whatsapp, facetime, etc.). The AirPods 1/2 are very natural like having nothing in your ears. But making calls with the AirPods in ANC mode is like talking under water or with your fingers in your ears (basically what ANC does). The Transparent mode (which pipes outside sound back into the earphones) makes calls closer to the AirPods 1/2 but still not as good as the external sounds (including your voice) are amplified and still unatural.<br />- audio quality is average (even low for the price). Initially the quality seems better than the AirPods 1/2; but this is just the ANC giving this impression. The drivers (the speaker unit inside the earphones) are basically the same as the AirPods 1/2. If you do a back to back comparison in a very quiet environment, the audio quality is the same and much lower than high-end earphones/headphones<br />- still no physical control volume: you still need to use your phone (what is the point of bluetooth) or use Siri (interrupts your music and obviously doesn‚Äôt work during a call)",0.96,,0.17551587301587301,,iPhone

"I did my research prior to replacing my 13&#34; MacBook Pro.  I had it for less than two years and barely used it because I had the same exact laptop for work.  I figured I'd offload my personal MBP since it was in mint condition and get something a bit more suitable for my uses.  I don't cut video, I don't record music, I'm not editing photos.  The MBP was too much machine for me and it was going to waste.  I surf the web, watch Netflix, check email, and - of course - shop on Amazon.  I was also seeking more portability; I wanted something I could carry in my backpack every single day and not even know it was there.  Since I'd be carrying it day in and day out, I wanted a laptop with a battery that would last.  I found all of those things in the 12&#34; MacBook.<br /><br />It's a laptop that's ACTUALLY the size of a notebook.  It's speedy, well-designed, and appealing to the eye.  I see a lot of folks commenting on the new keyboard but I've had no issues with it.  With a new design will obviously come a learning curve.  I've been typing on it all day and, to be completely honest, I can't tell the difference from my MBP.  I also see comments about it's speed.  To those people I ask this: what are you using this thing for?  You can't buy this laptop and expect it to be a video editing powerhouse.  That has NEVER been the job of a baseline MacBook, so why would you expect that to change?  Apple invented the Pro series MacBooks for all of you that were seeking something with more horsepower to edit video, photos, etc.  Stick with that.  Finally, I have to comment on the speakers.  This thing sounds REALLY good for it's size and also in comparison to my 13&#34; MBP.  I kinda can't believe it.  As a musician, I'm impressed with the audio it pumps out.<br /><br />I don't want to hear from the folks who say you can get a PC for much less money and do the same things.  I know you can.  But does it look as good?  Does it operate as flawlessly?  Will it last as long?  Will it work seamlessly with my iPhone?  No, no, no, and no.  Been there, done that.  All in all, this is a well-designed piece of technology.  I absolutely love it and would recommend it to anyone seeking something portable for light duty work.

"Apple has done it again. They have successfully begun to blur the line between iPod and iPhone by now adding GPS, an ambient light sensor, and a retina display. Oh, and there's one other thing, what was it... CAMERAS!! Although low quality, at only something like 0.5 MP for the rear one, now I can facetime on my iPod and point and shoot photos from the rear cam still look good on the retina display. 1 star ding because the A4 chip is laggy for about half my games and I hear this won't be getting iOS 7 but the iPhone 4 does even though it still has the same laggy A4 chip.

I find it totally amazing that a devise that small can hold so much.

"People are better off with something like sandisk sansa clip zip. The audio quality apple brags about is slightly better with sandisk sansa clip zip. Sandisk just is not as arrogant as apple to brag about it. Main disadvantages (according to me) of shuffle over clip zip are :-<br />1. Can't play 'flac'<br />2. Limited storage place (2GB is not enough, Sansa clip zip has memody card slot plus at least 4GB internal memory)<br />3. Limited navigation. Lack of screen leaves very less choice for navigating through songs.<br />4. itunes dependency. Can't simply drag n drop audio files.<br />The only thing that can be good for shuffle is they have better stock headphones. Other than that this product doesn't justify its price tag at all. Get a better headphone like Shure SE215 which can be used for long time with many devices. It has great audio quality,comfort and isolation. get a zlip zip or fiio x3 and enjoy music with quality.",0.9,,0.19116541353383457,,iPhone

Apple needs to look at how they are making the iPod shuffle. They only last about 6-9 months and then quick working. The shuffle they made 5 years ago latest at least 2-3 years.

"I am not an Apple enthusiast.  I don't own an iPhone or iPad much less a Mac-anything but I am on my third Nano (first one died after 2 years and inadvertently washed another).  I tend to be attracted to something because it's suitable for it's intended application.  The idea behind this product is ideal for anyone who exercises on a regular basis.  The ability to download so many songs onto a device which clips to your clothing and doesn't require a holder or strap is great. Unfortunately the Shuffle does not stand up to sweat or use in humid conditions.  I had a 2nd, 3rd, and now a 4th generation shuffle and they have all died from exposure to sweat.  I used the DLO action jacket on the previous version and even had a rubber sleeve for the most recent edition and the moisture still gets to it. I really enjoyed this thing and in most regards it's the perfect running companion but I bought it in August of 2012 and it gave out during a run today, November 19, 2013 (of course it is no longer in warranty). I usually run with it once or twice a week.  The symptoms came on suddenly and without warning.  Songs would start/stop, volume would rise and fall dramatically, then the device shut down.  I connected it to my computer and plugged it directly into a wall with no reaction.  Put it in rice and thus far, still nothing.I have tried the Sony W series all in one headphone/mp3 player promoted by Meb Keflezighi but it doesn't stay in my ears. I hesitate to give it less than 3 stars because outside of the lack of sweat resistance it is almost perfect but I can't give it a 2.5 so 2 stars it is. Due to the fact that there is no other device that fits my preferences for exercising, I will probably buy the next generation shuffle and see if there is an affordable protective case for it. The design needs more attention to detail but due to innovative form factor, Apple will more than likely get some more of my money.",0.86,,0.20018768768768766,,iPhone

"I have been using Windows machines for about the last 20 years.  For a change, I decided to try the Mac in late 2009 for a home machine, as I wasn't impressed with any of the PC/Win Vista laptop offerings at the time.  I use the Mac just about every day as a home computer for mail, surfing, photo organization, etc.  I also continue to work on a Windows machine at work - meaning I have to switch between the two daily.  A few main points I would like to share:<br /><br />1) Need to run Windows with BootCamp, Parallels, or VMWare - I purchased VMWare thinking I would need it, but haven't even installed it yet.  Most everything I need comes with the Mac, or is available on the Internet for free.  In fact, I have not purchased any software for the Mac, other than a word processor / spreadsheet application.  All file formats I use and/or create (PDF, DOC, XLS, JPG) can be passed between my Windows work machine and Mac w/o issues.<br /><br />2) The small form factor of this laptop, within the aluminum case make this a joy to fold up and carry around.  With any of the Windows laptop I have used, when you unfold the machine and start to use it again (waking from standby), you are not sure if the machine will wake up correctly, be connected to the Internet, etc.  The Mac works flawlessly in this respect, in that you open it and its ready to go in a few seconds.<br /><br />3) The screen / video is great.  I am sure you can get the same screens and video hardware in Windows based laptops, but you will have to pay a bit more.  Thus, for the hardware you get, you don't a lot more for the Mac than Windows PC (at least for the 13"" model)<br /><br />4) The machine is quiet, and you never hear the fan running.  I laugh as I write this as my wife's Toshiba fan is kicking in, making this terrible whirling noise.<br /><br />5) The touch pad is large, about twice the size of a typical Windows laptop.  This large size makes the OSX 'gestures' usable, for scrolling pages windows, moving back and forward, etc.  Once you get familiar with the gestures, its makes the laptop experience a lot better.  I find myself not needing the external mouse, and never use one.  One problem though, when I move to my Windows laptop, and by habit do the same gestures, w/o luck ;)<br /><br />6) OSX versus Windows - I think both are great OS's.  I will say though that the Mac/OSX environment is much more controlled, and this is where the advantage comes in for stability and performance.  Think about the fact that Windows must support 1000's of different hardware types, including device drivers for all of these.  The chances of instability, conflicts, etc. is quite high.  With the Mac, the hardware is very limited and specific, allowing developers to focus and test much better, with the results being a more stable platform.<br /><br />7) Applications - Windows has many more choices of applications.  However the limited number of applications available for the Mac is also sometimes a blessing as they are integrated better, and play nicely to together.  Take for example iPhoto integrated with iMovie, etc.  This become even more important if you have an iPhone, as you want to have a smaller set of 'good' applications playing nicely together.<br /><br />8) Mac Keyboard shortcuts - if you don't use a mouse, keyboard shortcuts make things happen much more quicker.  Mac has a lot of support for keyboard shortcuts, and you can do just about anything with a keyboard shortcut.  This makes the usability and experience much better, you just need to learn the shortcuts.<br /><br />9) Reliability - I have read some reviews both on Amazon and professional.  A computer is a computer, and if you abuse it, it will break.  Hard drives are hard drives, used both in Windows and Mac PCs.  Eventually they do fail, and the harder you are on your laptop (moving, shaking, bumping), the quicker they will fail.  The same goes for other components, great care is required to get maximum life.<br /><br />10) Support - While never needing support from Mac, I have read that its probably the best in the industry.  Combine that will the Apple Store, where you can walk in, and talk to a real person who understands English.  For anyone who is not that familiar with working with computers, this is a huge advantage.<br /><br />In summary, for the standard computer user who is not an IT wizard, the Mac Book makes a lot of sense.  Yes, the price of a Mac is higher, but if you combine the better stability along with the better support from Apple, its money well spent.",0.8,,0.21387936507936506,,iPhone

"I am quite surprised I would be providing such a negative review for an Apple product. I purchased these back in March last year. Love them for the convenience and use them regularly for my daily runs to listen to podcasts and music. However, I have had several issues and replacements in the last 9 months that I could only give it two stars. The first issue happened in Sept 2020, where one of the airpods stopped connecting to my iPhone. After calling product support and they tried troubleshooting the issue, they suggested that I receive a replacement airpod and so I did.<br /><br />Yet again, in Dec, the left airpod stopped working. And yet again I had to go through the same grind of getting a replacement and returning my current one (the Fedex that accepts battery included products is 20 miles away from home - so, it was hugely inconvenient for me).<br /><br />It is January 23rd 2021 when I am writing this review and for the third time, the left airpod stopped working again.<br /><br />In each of these instances, what I have observed is that I need to push the airpod in a specific way into the wireless charger and it manages to start charging. However, I need to keep the wireless charger in a specific position (such as vertical) for the airpod to charge inside it.<br /><br />For a $250 Apple product, I would expect it to be hassle free, but honestly, I have had to spend hours and hours trying to troubleshoot issues. The other challenge is that, given there are no visual indicators on the airpods, it is very hard to tell which airpod has run out of battery or had other issues - so, it is practically impossible even for Apple support to debug problems when they occur.<br /><br />I am quite surprised how I could have been unlucky three times in a row, but I am receiving yet another replacement and hoping that this ends all my miseries. That said, my limited warranty is close to ending - so, this is perhaps my last opportunity to receive a replacement without incurring a charge.<br /><br />Come on Apple, you can do better!",0.96,,0.009616815476190478,,iPhone
"As an avid ipod follower since my 80gb classic, I was super excited to see what additions they were going to make to the touch. I currently have a 32gb 3rd gen touch and I have been waiting forever for Apple to add a camera to it. Unfortunately, my feelings went from OMG they put a camera on it!!! to this is a piece of crap!!! It is pitiful they put a 0.7 mp camera on there. That's twice as bad as my dad's flip phone from 7 years ago!!! Not only did they add this deplorable excuse for a camera, they also fudged a lot of the new features. I really want to upgrade to a 64gb, but for $400 freaking dollars I better get my money's worth! My Droid x cost only half and has a resolution that rivals my actual camera! This is a sad excuse for an ipod and it seems every year I dislike Apple more because of their practices and prices. Apple really needs to be put in it's place and I will not buy another Apple product until they lower the price and actually give consumers a quality product.

"I got these for my wife as a graduation gift because she was all over them when they got announced but ended up returning them after we both used them for a few weeks. As a lover of other apple products, I can‚Äôt get along with these either. Regular airpods fall out of my ears, these are so big they irritate them no matter how I twist them, and her complaint was the same, after an hour they hurt. Sound quality is good, but my $30 buds sound damn close and these certainly aren‚Äôt 8x better. Noise cancelling is legit, definitely a win with these and probably the only feature I thought was good. I also had problems pairing to my iPhone, but they work fine with my wife‚Äôs iPhone and MacBook, we both run the same software too. If I open the case next to my phone it would not recognize them unless I manually went into Bluetooth settings and paired them like my cheap earbuds. Also the lack of volume control on the buds is a huge fail on Apple‚Äôs part. Overall just not impressed, especially for the price, I know the overall package is nice and so is noise cancelling, but I can‚Äôt forgive that these cost $250 and sound only marginally better than my 2 year old off-brand $30 buds. One final issue is that their case is poorly designed. The lid doesn‚Äôt click into place firmly when open so the smallest handling error and the lid wants to shut. This happens more than you‚Äôd think considering how far the buds sit inside the case and how hard they are to pull out, often falling out as they slip from your fingers. When the lid is closed it rattles and twists back and forth like some cheap dinky piece of plastic.",0.96,,0.12473867595818815,,iPhone

"I was a little skeptical about whether I‚Äôd really find any use in this. It was a toss up between a Garmin smartwatch and this. Mostly I was getting one of them for the rowing tracking, and the Garmin watch I was looking at cost $1,000, plus had mixed reviews of its heart rate tracking. Ultimately I bought the Apple Watch because I could get it with a 25% discount on Prime Day. Plus, the Garmin had too many bells and whistles that I just didn‚Äôt need. Things like maps for golf courses, maps of terrain and state parks, stuff like that. I‚Äôm glad I went with the Apple Watch. The heart rate tracking‚Äôs been great plus all of the health things you can do with it. Most reviews I‚Äôve seen have said the heart rate tracking‚Äôs been the most accurate of lots of watches and I‚Äôve noticed that that‚Äôs probably correct. The rowing app doesn‚Äôt have many bells and whistles, but I‚Äôve thought about integrating my Concept2 rowing machine with the watch to pull in more data. Not sure I‚Äôll do that since I‚Äôm not a competitive rower, but might be fun to do. The app counts calories, heart rate, time, etc. I‚Äôm assuming all of the fitness apps like running, cycling, etc. probably all count the same kinds of things. I noticed that the PM4 on my Concept2 and its calorie counter was pretty close to the calorie counter on this watch. So not sure what algorithm‚Äôs being used there. The watch does lots of other things so I rarely take it off. Plus I‚Äôm already tied into the Apple ecosystem with my Mac Mini and iPhone, so if you‚Äôre the same, it makes sense to go with this watch if you‚Äôre looking for a smart watch. Definitely if you can get it at a discount on Prime Day or something.",0.96,,0.19382440476190477,,iPhone

"Why the heck do I need an Apple Watch?<br /><br />These were my first thoughts... and second, and third.<br /><br />Now, six months later, I've found myself using it a lot more than my phone. I use it for my alarm, for my workouts, for audiobooks, for checking the weather... and most importantly, for leaving home without my phone. It is the ONLY device that I have on me all the time, as my phone usually sits in a bag or drawer or somewhere where it won't distract me.<br /><br />This device is brilliant because I can do all the productive stuff without actually getting myself distracted by Safari or Facebook or anything similar. And while I do prefer FitBit in many regards, mostly because of the community aspect and the fact that it actually tracks steps and not calories (not to mention that you can track sleep by default and it works, compared to third party sleep trackers on IOS), it is also a good fitness watch.<br /><br />It's not as good as a FitBit, I find the FitBit more accurate and intuitive and fun to use, but it does its job.<br /><br />I never expected to like it so much but I do. Almost everything I do on this device improves my life in some way. I can do meditation or run or check my calendar, but I can't play games or surf the Internet. It's like having a mobile phone minus all the media consumption which is great.<br /><br />Should I upgrade to the 4th generation?<br /><br />Not really. I had an ECG done in a hospital like two weeks ago and I don't feel the need for this feature on 24/7. Also, while the fall alarm is useful, I feel I can live without it. Sure, it could save my life someday but truth be told, since I travel and I'm mostly alone, if I slip on the bathroom floor, it's still up to me to get up. I mean, I don't know, maybe those are features I'd end up loving too but not enough to pay another $400 to buy the new generation one.<br /><br />I'm happy with this one. It's fast, the battery life is consistently two days (even with streaming audio the battery life is impressive), it is durable and it looks nice. I guess I'd rather have the Samsung one, due to the circular screen and input but I have an iPhone and the only thing that works on iPhones are the Apple Watches so that's that...<br /><br />I have thought a long time if I should switch back to FitBit. If someone would buy it from me for 75% - 80% of the price I paid, yes, I'd change to FitBit, because I have +100 friends there and the fitness features are more important than the smartwatch ones. But otherwise, it is fine.<br /><br />So sure, you won't know why you want it until you use it. After that, it makes a LOT of sense.",0.96,,0.27693698347107437,,iPhone

Also a simple equalizer would be nice to adjust to what you like.<br /><br />What I like the most...<br />1) It connects flawlessly to my iphone, every time!

"(update) I got a replacement pair and this time worked perfect. I have been using my regular iPhone 7 earpods (wired) for quite a while and been quite happy with them, especially because I've been using a very effective and cheap earpod covers anti-slip, which completely changed the usability of those earpods. I also have a pair of Bose earpods that have noise-reduction but are also wired and the little box with the control for on-off for NR is quite annoying. So, after some initial time spent with the Airpods Pro, I can say I'm very happy with the sound quality, the NR is probably not as good as the Bose, but good enough, and overall they are very comfortable to wear. I've only used them for a couple of conversations, so I still have to evaluate how good they are for phone calls.<br />------<br />(initial review)<br />I received a defective pair. Initial battery charged was done but while it showed 100% for the right earbud, the left was only ~85%. I then connected them to my iphone, the right earbud worked fine but the left did not work.

"I haven‚Äôt owned an iPad since the first one came out. Back then the pencil didn‚Äôt exist and you used a pen with a rubber tip.<br /><br />I ordered this and the 2nd gen pencil with the intention of getting back into doodling and writing- it has become so much more. I find myself using my phone less and less. While I haven‚Äôt been able to use my PC due to renovating I don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôd use it in place of this.

"This is the model I've been waiting for, one with a built-in camera. I sold my old Touch, iPod, and Nano after I bought this.

"I currently have an I pod touch 3rd generation player that I have enjoyed for a couple of years.  I use it to play music, watch movies, store pictures to show friends and several I tunes apps to play games or get information. This Christmas while visiting family and friends one of our nephews happened to have the 4th generation I pod touch. We compared the overall features and I liked the two camera addition along with the voice recording. He was able to use his wireless feature to connect to his fathers cell phone and make internet calls.  So after the holidays I went on line to check for a used or a refurbished 4th generation I pod. I have bought other products the same way and have been satisfied with pass results. Products that are refurbished generally carry some type of warranty that is close to a new product warranty and save you quit a bit of money.  This helps when you buy products that have fixed pricing from the manufacturer like Apple or Microsoft. I do the same type of shopping when going to Best-Buy, Target, Walmart etc. I look for something I want and then ask if they have an open box, display or clearance one available. This also works for me shopping on-line.  I have bought many things through Amazon checking for both new and used.<br /><br />Back to to the I pod touch 4th generation.  The latest I pod touch has been a real pleasure.  I like the the two camera features.  It allows me to carry my music, photos, videos and gaming entertainment as well as take pictures and movies on the go.  In the pass I might forget to take my camera but have my I pod touch player or to take my camera and forget my I pod touch player; now I have both. I guess I could have gotten a I phone but I didn't want to to pay a monthly feed that can get pretty expensive. Now that I have the 4th generation I pod the other differences are the screen resolution which is better one the new model. The speaker sound is also better and the size is thinner. The new I pod also has a larger memory to allow for more apps, music, video and pictures. I'm still learning some of the things it can do.  I haven't tried to hook up to person's cell phone or try to make a internet call. There were only few negative things I can think of. I wish the still picture was a higher quality; 2 mega pixel or 4 mega pixel would be just fine. The video camera quality was good and can be zoomed in on in play back mode. I would have like to see an app from I tunes that allowed you to make internet calls in a Wi-Fi area. Overall I'm very happy with my purchase.",0.9,,0.1964646464646465,,iPhone
"Update:  after last long run before the NYC marathon this next week, these died.  Again, I'm not a big sweater but it looks like it killed these not so ""sweat proof"" headphones<br /><br />I usually don't write reviews but appreciate ones that people do.  I am training for another marathon and really loved my Jaybird Bluebuds a lot.  However, they crapped out during a downpour and decided to see what else was out there.  The good about the beats is that they stay in the ear much better than the Jaybirds.  Firstly, the ear cushions have a lip that holds them onto the earphones.  The jaybirds just slide on.  I found myself recently removing my Jaybirds only to have to fish the cushions out of my ear canal.  The down side is they don't fit ""in"" the ear that well so you don't get quite as nice of sound.  Also, the bluetooth seems to have the same problem that the original Jaybirds had that if you had your iPod in a certain position on your body the bluetooth would cut in and out.  This is really prominent with my nano, though not as much with the iPhone 5s.  Finally, the big thing I don't like about the Powerbeats is that the control talk module doesn't seem to be sweat resistant.  After about 15mins into a run, sweat must get into the module and you lose the ability to control the vol and FF or Rev!!!  The Jaybirds were bombproof in regards to sweat!",0.82,,0.18190131124913733,,iPhone

"......Four stars.<br /><br />And it would have been decidedly less if the device got damaged in shipping.<br /><br />I've had the iPod touch now for 34 months, a superb item. Finally, after this particular iPod is no longer sold I've found the time to write a review that can only cite the packing manner from Amazon for the piece.<br /><br />The iPod itself was in its plastic case the size of a deck of cards......freely rattling around in a box half the size of a phone book! No inner packing to suspend the iPod in its shipping box, just free to bound around in there. NOT ACCEPTABLE for a device that cost $365 with a life intended to manage electrons.<br /><br />So this initial experience cited at this late date will suggest that the iPod touch 4th generation is one tough cookie. It's been flawless for me......but I never cared much for iTunes as a program to manage the iPod. I'm probably in a minority there but I think the navigating is ponderous and confusing.<br /><br />Lastly since early on, I used an Incipio Hive dermaSHOT Shock-Absorbing Silicone Case with bulging corners to protect the iPod, a fine product.",0.9,,0.14796296296296296,,iPhone
"I bought this item after selling my iPhone to buy a secondhand iPad and needed a small, affordable music player for on the go.<br /><br />My unit arrived with a loose play button and the back metal plate was popping up in the corner.  Needless to say, I contact Amazon and they were AMAZING with my request for an exchange, like always.  This is why I return to shop at Amazon.  No hassle.... quick, prepaid return label... overnight Saturday shipping of the replacement iPod.  The representative apologized and was knowledgable.m Can't ask for more.<br /><br />On the other hand, I have always been lukewarm on Apple's quality control.  The second unit actually arrived with a crooked clickwheel, but I will not bother with an exchange because it is such a minor issue.  Apple quality is hit or miss- at least for me.  I've had probably 50 Apple products over the years and I usually wind up having some quality control problem on my first purchase about 75% of the time.  Perhaps I am simply unlucky!  Bottom line- just check your items for any issues when they arrive and don't hesitate to contact Amazon if anything is wrong.  You don't have to be afraid that you will have to justify your exchange, get a rep that doesn't understand you, or spend all day on the phone (you can speak with an Amazon associate any time of the day or night through online chat).<br /><br />Anyway, once I manage to get an Apple product without manufacturing flaws, they are rivaled by no other.  This is simply the best  super small player you will find.  The simplicity is what draws me.  The iPod shuffle has one purpose- music.  Absolutely no other features - no extraneous watch faces, internet browsers, photos app.... just music.  You've got voiceover, which is a must have for a displayless iPod.  The buttons are easy to remember for play, pause, ff, rewind.... but if anyone is used to using a 6th gen iPod nano,mthey may mistake the shuffle switch and voiceover buttons on top for volume buttons out of habit.  Sound quality is absolutely astounding for a player this small!  It is not tinny at all.  Two things to note- I do wish the capacity was a bit larger than 2 GB, but not a huge deal.  Also, it can get frustrating trying to open the clip.  The clip's hinge is pretty strong and the device is a bit slippery... not to mention that it is almost impossible to open the clio without pressing the rewind or play pause button. I also wish the hinge of the clip was on the right side of the device rather than the left as I am right handed and instinctively go to press the wrong side every time I try to open the clip.<br /><br />One hint for those who may not know- you can ""lock"" the buttons so that you don't accidently press them while working out or what have you.  To do this, all you have to do is press and hold the play pause button until you hear a lock sound through the headphones (while the device is on of course).  Your controls will now be locked until you repeat the process and hear the unlocking sound to unlock them.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this device for its convenient size, simplicty and amazing sound, barring a few minor annoyances with the clip and hit or miss assembly quality.",0.86,,0.04691167675861554,,iPhone

"This review is mostly geared towards active/athletic use, but for normal day use these AirPods are more than adequate. They have great dynamic range and clarity. The provided silicone attachments should cover most ear sizes. However, if different type/sizes are required they need to be specific to AirPods, because the connection and oval shape. For active/normal use, if you have already used the previous AirPod models, these are definitely a nice upgrade. They sound as if a subwoofer was added, which is great. But there are some specific drawbacks.<br /><br />First, when using silicone attachments there is a vacuum seal. If you are not used to having silicone attachments, this can take some getting used to, especially when running. There is a noticeable boom noise on your eardrums when your body is in motion, because of the vacuum seal. You have to crank up the volume to compensate. This may not work for some users.<br /><br />Second, the noise cancellation and transparency settings do not work as well when in motion, or if you have a hat on that covers the AirPods. The computer chip tries to compensate, but distorts the audio a bit to where clarity of sound is worse when they‚Äôre enabled. Probably because the chip has to work extra hard at dealing with constant external noise changes. Turning off the settings works much better for clarity in motion.<br /><br />For normal everyday use, the noise cancellation and transparency settings work quite well. I work in an office that uses white noise generators, and the noise cancellation setting blocks everything out. Transparency works good, but you still have to turn down the volume if you want to have a conversation with someone at the same time.<br /><br />So to summarize:<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Sound quality is much improved from previous models.  Dynamic range is much greater.<br />2. Battery life appears to be better, especially when talking.<br />3. The pause/next/prev song clicking options are a nice feature.<br />4. Siri enabled control is a bonus.<br />5. Shorter tip design.<br />6. Wireless charging.<br />7. Bluetooth connection with iPhone is virtually flawless at way more than 33ft (more like 100ft), even in a busy gym environment, and pairs in seconds.<br />8. AirPods automatically connect to last known device when inserting them in ears.<br />9. Music/Audio will pause/resume automatically when pulling out from/putting back into ear.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Vacuum seal of silicone attachments causes eardrum booming noise when body in motion.<br />2. Noise cancellation and transparency settings distort audio when body in motion.<br />3. Removing AirPods from charging case is not so easy, especially when fingers are moist.<br />4. Provided charging cable uses USB-c connection, which means a different wall adapter for charging is required.",0.96,,0.18900226757369615,,iPhone

While this system is very thin, light, and fast, it lacks appropriate options for connectivity to legacy devices.

"Literally the worst iPhone I have ever used and probably the worst phone. I‚Äôve been an iPhone user for the last 10 years and I‚Äôve used my old iPhone SE and been so happy with it since it came out. But it‚Äôs a few years old now and the battery life is not good and I thought it was time to upgrade and so I was excited to see that iPhone had added a new SE. this iPhone is complete garbage. The Bluetooth has trouble communicating with devices that I‚Äôve used my old phone with for years, The lightning port is unreliable. Sometimes it sends audio sometimes it doesn‚Äôt. Voice recognition crap. Auto correct crap. I liked the fact that it still had a home button but it‚Äôs not actual button and you can‚Äôt turn off the vibration function so every time you push it your phone vibrates. I don‚Äôt want that I should be able to turn that off. At the end of the day if you‚Äôre thinking about getting a new iPhone don‚Äôt get the SE and I will probably be going back to my old iPhone SE and continue to use it until it absolutely dies and then I‚Äôll get something different. And I‚Äôll give this phone to my dog to play with or maybe I‚Äôll keep it as a back up or just throw it out. It might just be that I got a bad phone but if you‚Äôre spending money even on a low budget entry level Apple product you expect Apple quality. That‚Äôs why I on a MacBook Pro and why I‚Äôve been an apple iPhone users since 2010. I would‚Äôve been so happy if they just took the original iPhone SE upgraded the camera put a new battery in it and maybe a nicer screen the same size.

"Review from a PhD Student<br />--------<br />So, I thought a lot about which laptop to get and learned some things along the way. The following review is aimed at those who are in a similar position to me: I am a graduate student whose life revolves around the laptop but I'm tired of carrying weight or having to decide whether to take my laptop with me or not. This a long review so I've decided it into a few sections; the first one is personal and about why I decided to try out the laptop, it might be useful but feel free to skip it.<br /><br />Section I: Why I considered this laptop<br />  My first laptop was a 2011 apple macbook pro; a computer that I've grown to consider legendary by now (it'll be five years this fall and is still going very strong *knock on wood*). Before that laptop I had windows pc desktop's. My sony viao lasted the longest but felt slow after a few years (and cost $2000 at the time); my Dell crapped out entirely. My MBpro had a low resolution screen for the time but it was nice quality and the track pad and keyboard were spot on along with the processor. But most of all, my MBpro still feels like it can take whatever I usually throw at it; so I wanted my next computer to be a Mac. The main issue for me after transferring schools was the weight of my MBpro; 4.5 pounds is not a lot but carrying it around all day with my tight neck muscles became a real pain.<br />  I tried using a tablet but I found again and again found that I needed the speed and power of a full operating system (mathematica, quicker browsing, image editing, so on). Tablets are great, but with 20+ windows open, the sensitivity of a trackpad (you can cover the whole screen in 4inches) is necessary. With the tablets not sufficient for me and weight saving a big issue, I decided to invest in a new macbook; which one, however, was the main issue. I went and tried the new MacBooks and came to a very different conclusion than I expected; most of that is clear in the review that follows.<br /><br />Section 2: Initial Impressions<br />  Trying out the 12-inch MacBook next to the retina macbook pro 13 and 15 inch, it was clear that it was the 12 inch that was the vision of the future. Deceptively thin, incredibly light, the most beautiful screen I had ever seen (more about the screen in Section III) and a keyboard that made a delicious mechanical clack. Yet, everyone at the store and on many websites discouraged me from buying the 12-inch. Why? &#34;Too slow, too little travel, too small, more fashion than laptop, too few ports, definitely spend extra for the faster processers&#34; were the main comments. Perhaps these were notes worth considering but I felt quite strongly that they were simply missing the point. As the reviews came in about the second gen not fixing these issues, I began to feel more and more something had gone wrong. This is a minimalist laptop. Forget the displays, forget the usb, just let cloud services and bluetooth handle the rest. Most of all, only keep what is absolutely necessary on a laptop. I decided to put my money where my mouth was and purchased the 12-inch MacBook (I bought the core m3 because I didn't want to hear the &#34;oh, but that's an upgraded model&#34;) and after a few weeks of use have the following thoughts (will update as time goes on) and, by God, is it refreshing.<br /><br />Section III: Non-Work Use<br />  The next section is for work use. For watching videos, writing emails, and surfing website, this is easily the best laptop i have ever used. The keyboard has low travel but it is easy to get used to (anyone saying otherwise has some real brain plasticity issues) and the mechanical clack the keys make is scrumdiliumptious. The screen is the best quality screen I have personally ever seen (I won't lie, something about 2k on a 12 inch screen is just next level; I have a 10.5 inch Samsung Tab S but even with OLED it still doesn't have the oomph this screen does--I know, weird). Some photos and videos (google costa rica 4k on youtube) are beyond breathtaking. Text is clear and sharp as well. The sound is also great, the built is speaker has more bass than one would expect and the midrange is forward and present; again, absolutely top notch stuff. Additionally, the laptop is silent. No fan, no noise. It feels downright to be able to do as much work as one can on it and not hear a fan. Also, the force touch trackpad does the impossible and improves on a track pad that was near perfect.<br />  But what really sells this for daily use is its speed in opening apps. I found in the past that I used my macbook pro less and less for daily non-work activities because of the weight (compared to my iPhone) and waking it from sleep and opening apps took longer (10-12 seconds). This thing is on and waiting the second the screen opens, logs in near instantaneously and the apps are usually open within 3 seconds of a click. We are a spoiled people, I shouldn't be complaining that my old laptop takes 10 seconds longer to open things but it just somehow matters.<br />  Note, I don't mind waiting for things if they are made to take time. For example, when I am compiling mathematica code I expect to be able to take a break and check some websites; but if I am asking safari to open or word, I likely have something I want to get start on (in other words, once I am started a couple second in the middle are okay, but the apps and files need to be read for me). This will matter in the next section because I think core m processors are exactly the right compromise; they turbo to speed to get you what you need, then settle down at a lower ghz to finish the &#34;middle&#34; parts of many jobs.<br /><br />Section 4: Using the Laptop Professionally<br />  The weight, the weight, the weight. Say what you will, but I hate feeling weighed down by things. I have neck muscle issues and carrying even an extra pound can mean more pain than I care for. With my macbook pro I had to ask myself if I absolutely needed my laptop, with this that is never a question. This is the &#34;always with you&#34; laptop. Put it in your bad and forget about it. First of all, that immediately makes it better than 90% of laptops for me including my beloved 2011 MacBook Pro. The question is if the lightness is worth the other compromises.<br />  So, how does it feel work-performance wise? Well, it is way better than expected. As a graduate student I have a PS4 for games and I am more concerned with research in Safari and pdf readers than hardcore video edits and I can easily open many tabs and listen to music while having my mail and messages app open in the background. Sometimes, if I have a large PDF open it can become only slightly slower but its such a slight change that I just can't be bothered by it (also, the pdf's are so crisp and clear that I don't have room to complain). The ram is very quick and OS X tries to predict what you are going to do so it's faster; if you surprise it, again, somethings might be a tad slower, but we're really nitpicking here. But, then, it is also so so so much faster than my 2011 MBpro in many things. Sure, GeekBench scores say there are about equal, but the SSD means that Pages opens in 3-4 seconds while my MBpro took 13-15. Additionally, the screen is so crisp and clear that I can easily have Notes and Safari/PDF open in split view and still have resolution to spare (which, strangely, means that my 12 inch macbook's screen allows for more real estate than my 13.3 inch non-retina macbook pro). You might not think that is &#34;speed&#34; but being able to have two windows clearly open means that I don't have to scroll back and forth. That is time saved and exactly the sort of thing people miss when talking about a computers quickness.<br />  Would a 13.3 retina MBpro be faster? Well, of course, I've used them and they are fantastic; plus the newer one releasing in September will likely to be a monstrosity. If you are doing blackhole simulations, get that. If you are doing research reading papers, mathematica, image edits (depending on size, of course) and want a laptop that can actually always be with you, I don't see anything beating this.<br />  Also, a note about the core m3 processors. Yes, they are 1.1 ghz but it almost never has to dip down that low. I've used this as I normally use my laptops and only a couple of times has the processor gotten even near its full potential and, when it has, it is because some video and graphics intensive website were doing some downright unoptimized and nasty processor hogging (and I had way too many tabs playing anyway). My first reaction was: &#34;holy frijoles, how did they get these things to feel so zippy without any fans!).<br />  These processors are built to turbo to higher speeds, finish the job and come back down to more modest speeds (but even here modest is 1.5+ ghz). They can't stay up there like fan-cooled processors, but ask yourself: &#34;Do you really do work all the time that requires a processor to stay at 3.5 ghz?&#34; &#34;Really?&#34; Let me put it another way, if a core m3 isn't enough for you than you likely already know that; you're someone who knows that their workload is so processor heavy that you have skipped the core i5 and get the core i7 in every computer you have bought. For my work, the core m3 feels not just fast but reliable (forget the geek bench scores, that is a whole different story). And if someone is tasking their processor by doing basic activities, then its their sloppy habits that are to blame more so than the processor (surely we can be expected to change to get the best out of a laptop too?). The only difference I see between the core m3 and i5 is that the m3 sometimes asks you to give it a little more time to do SOME tasks (it says &#34;give me a second&#34; and never yells &#34;what the hell are you doing!!!&#34;). For the benefits of weight, complete silence, ergonomics and, when compared a whole, I don't feel the processor is a let down.<br />---------<br />Final Thoughts: I'll update and edit this review to be better, but I feel genuinely fortunate that the 12-inch macbook was everything I was expecting and more. It's light enough that it is always with you (thus making it &#34;practically&#34; faster than many other laptops). Its processor turbos when needed and settles down when it isn't and, more importantly, feels very zippy and reliable. It might take an extra-minute but it doesn't feel laggy or stressed when it does it. The keyboard clicks wonderfully, the force tough track pad is an improvement on near-perfection, and the sound is fantastic from the speakers.

"These are fantastic. Literally the most magical technology I think I‚Äôve purchased to date. I was going to go with the Bose wireless, noise cancelling head phones. They are somewhat comparable in price, and known to be good quality, and Apple didn‚Äôt have any similar products. Plus I never was impressed with the quality of the Apple ear buds or AirPods anyway. They always fell out. But then the AirPods pros came out. Similarly priced to Bose, but 1) because I‚Äôm already an Apple user, I thought it would be easier to use with my iPhone, 2) they are truly wireless, and 3) they come with a nifty case that also quickly charges the earbuds wirelessly multiple times.<br /><br />That being said, I‚Äôm in love with them and I swear they are the most magical piece of technology I‚Äôve ever owned. I‚Äôm no audio expert and I don‚Äôt use them for music much (nor am I an audio quality snob), so I can‚Äôt speak to the sound quality. But I use them on construction sites to help cancel engine noise while also being able to listen to podcasts at a lower volume, and for that they are absolutely perfect. Without having quantitative measurements, it feels like they cancel noise to about the same degree as ear plugs. They don‚Äôt fall out of my ears as I‚Äôm walking around and I use them pretty much all day. I‚Äôve even used them underneath ear muffs.<br /><br />I can‚Äôt recommend these enough.

"I've had the beats solo2 wireless for over a year now, and I use them for everything from the gym to sitting at home with my computer.  For the price, I expected these headphones to work great and last long.  Well, they do work great, but they don't last long.  I bought these after having a pair of wired solo's stop working on me after one month.  Shortly after purchasing the solo2's, they managed to stop working.  I started to get a crackling noise in one of the speakers which was very annoying.  The customer service was top notch though, and sent me a new pair of beats solo2 wireless really quick.  A few months after receiving the new pair, the ear pad started falling off, exposing the foam.  At this point I actually bought a replacement ear pad and put it on myself.  To be honest, between my wife and I we have had 5 pairs of Beats solo headphones, 1st and 2nd generation, and they have all broken.  My first pair of Beats wired solo's ended up having a broken wire and the ear pads and headband fell off.  My wife's wired solo2's ended up getting a static noise and were replaced by Beats.<br /><br />I'm not a sound expert, but they are a great full range headphone.  I do like bass though and often have to change the EQ on my iPhone to get the deeper bass.  They also look very good, packaged well, come with a carrying case, and connect to your bluetooth devices super quick.  They lay pretty good on my head, although they don't completely cover my ears and have a tendency to slide off of my head during workouts.  All in all, they are not worth the asking price.  If you are able to get them on sale or with a gift card I would take a cautious chance on them, but I would never pay full price for these again.  I actually just bought the Sony MDR XB950BT's and they fit my head way better, have a killer bass boost, and cost $150.",0.8800000000000001,,0.1687878787878788,,iPhone

Sound quality is really good. Not as good as the Jaybirds which have a deeper bass. However the Jaybirds fall out while working out or running. These stay in really well during running. The color and style is nice. The big problem is that as others have said there is a sync issue with video. When watching video on my iphone 6 I get delay of the audio. The delay does not happen on Jaybirds. I have seen others write they have called Beats and they don't seem to care. So my suggestion is let's buy them and all return these so Beats gets the message they need to fix the sync problem. I would think a lot of returns vs people not buying them would send a stronger message. Anyway mine go back to best buy today. Ofcourse if you use only for music then you are fine but then again its the principle.,0.82,,0.3515151515151515,,iPhone

"Over 125k reviews and practically 5 stars.  There‚Äôs a reason for it.  I was reluctant to get a nice set of ear buds because of the cost.  My wife has some nice Sony over the ear headphones with noise cancelling and they‚Äôre nice when we travel and I was getting jealous.  We bought a new MacBook and they offered these at a deep discount so I bought them.  Having used them now I would not hesitate to spend the money on them.  The noise canceling is great. I mow grass with them and can‚Äôt hear the mower. I use them for zoom meetings at work and I use them when running. The transparency mode is equally great.  The special audio is amazing.  I use them almost daily and I‚Äôm very happy.  Pairing to iPhone XR is seamless, transitioning from phone audio to earbud (and vise versa) is easy and works great.  I can watch a movie on my phone (or audio) and when I remove the earbud it pauses and when I put it back in it resumes.  The ONLY thing I wish they had was a way to control volume from the AirPod other than using Siri.  I would highly recommend if you‚Äôre looking for a quality earbud.",0.96,,0.3812133237133237,,iPhone

"Yup, do not buy these.  Work great for about two months and then the charge will not hold in them.  Now mine are to the point that they will not charge up past 0.  Customer support does not really help either.  They tell you to do all the simple things like reset them and update them.  Plan on going in full circles if you want to talk to customer support....google the issue works better than anything apple care can help. Apparently when you buy these and wear them, according to apple, you must lay still in bed, not move your head, and not touch the headphones at all in order for them to work great.  If you sweat in them, (ironic for workout headphones) do not plan on having the warranty upheld.  Hard to believe a apple product and a name as beats by dre would have this issue with a charge...believe the reviews when you see that they truly do not hold a charge.

"Music used to be a huge part of my life; I almost always had something playing on the stereo.  Then we moved to a larger house, and it seemed like the music stopped.  Our nicest stereo was in the living room.  Our CD collection was upstairs, though some of it was on the computer in the office.  And we spent most of our time in other parts of the house.  It's long been a dream of mine to play the same music throughout the house; with the Airport Express, this dream became a reality, and I'm listening to music all of the time again.<br /><br />I bought one to give it a try; this let me stream music from my Vista PC to the living room stereo on the same floor (while still playing via the PC speakers).  I was hooked, and immediately copied the rest of our CDs to the computer.<br /><br />After a few weeks, I bought another AirPort Express to stream the music to a pair of powered speakers upstairs ([[ASIN:B00113V748 Creative Labs GigaWorks T40 Premium 2.0 Multimedia Speaker System with BasXPort Technology]]).  All three music sources (the computer and the two Airport Express-connected speaker systems) are always in sync and drop outs have been very rare.  It's really quite amazing; you can walk throughout the house and hear the same music everywhere.  Of course you want to be able to control the music from where you are in the house, so I bought an [[ASIN:B001FA1NZK Apple iPod touch 8 GB (2nd Generation)]] to use as a remote (the iPhone works as well).  The whole setup is just so cool!<br /><br />I recently bought a third Airport Express.  I don't stream music through this one; I use it as a wireless bridge to allow an old iMac without a wireless card to access my network.  This one performs flawlessly; you set it up and forget it.  I could also stream music through this one if I had another pair of speakers to connect to it.<br /><br />Although I think this is an amazing product, I almost docked it one star because the setup and interoperability with non-Apple hardware isn't as seamless as it should be.<br /><br />I connected my first two Airport Expresses to a non-Apple Wireless G access point (a 2WIRE DSL router).  For security reasons, I do not broadcast the SSID on my wireless network.  I could not get the AirPort Expresses to join my network with the SSID broadcast off (even though I typed in the network name); I had to broadcast the SSID, join them to the network, then stop broadcasting the SSID.  That wasn't that big of deal, but it took me at least 30 minutes to figure it out and it's not how it should work.  These units also had a tendency to drop out of the AirPort utility software when they connected via this access point.<br /><br />When I got the third one, I bought an [[ASIN:B000UZCR56 Apple AirPort Extreme Base Station (Gigabit) MB053LL/A]] to use as my main access point (these can't act as a bridge on a non-Apple wireless network).  I set this up as Wireless-N only, I still use the old access point for B/G.<br /><br />The third AirPort Express also had setup problems- the AirPort Utility software couldn't communicate with it until I did a factory reset.  After the factory reset, it was easy as pie, though.  I had no problems joining the AirPort Expresses to the Apple base station, even with the SSID broadcast turned off.  So, in my experience, these do work with non-Apple access points, but they work much better with an Apple base station.  On the plus side, the AirPort Utility works well under Windows; I don't think you need a Mac to get the most out of this.<br /><br />Those minor hassles aside, this is the most impressive computing/home entertainment product that I've seen in a long time- it's somewhat expensive, but you get a lot of features for your money.

"Yes the price isn't the most affordable, but who is forcing these peoples hands to purchase a high end pair of headphones besides themselves. I use a wide variety of headphones from leisure use to studio engineering and these headphones are at the lowest a 7 on a scale from 1 to 10. For equalizers on most devices you  simply need to set your levels to flat because these carry a very balanced sound with portable devices i.e. iPhones, iPods, iPads. On my MacBook the eq sucked but that's obviously the MacBooks equalizer if I get a completely different sound from my portable devices. The warranty is great, durability is solid, stylish maybe I guess, and sound quality is above average. I think Bose has more of an acoustic sound compared to these. And they are overdriven like the Beats by Dre Studios (first generation atleast). My opinion is ppl will side with what they prefer and some dislike this brand just as some dislike Apple over PC and vice versa. So go for what you like, but these are below average or basic sounding. People just need to learn how to use third EQ.",0.78,,0.19934782608695653,,iPhone

"I recently owned the first Magic Mouse and returned it to BestBuy literally 1 day before Apple released this Magic Mouse 2.<br /><br />When I had the first Magic Mouse, having batteries for it wasn't really a con since the battery lasted a pretty long time.  But now that I have the Magic Mouse 2, I am SO glad it has a built in rechargeable battery. And an added on bonus about this Magic Mouse 2 is that I can use my iPhone's lightning connector to charge up the mouse, or use the lighting connector provided in the box.  Apple says the charge on this mouse is suppose to last for about a month or more, and so far I can say that it's living up to Apple's words.<br /><br />As far as design goes, I love it! This mouse's sleek design makes it look really good! I am a male and I have medium sized hands, and I will say that it did take me a while to get used to holding this mouse since it doesn't fit in the curve of your hand like most other mouses do.  The gestures that you can do with this mouse are super cool and it feels very natural, especially if you are fond of the Macbook's Trackpad or the Wireless Trackpad.<br /><br />The only downside I had with this mouse (1st and 2nd version) was the price...and the bluetooth connection issues.

BEWARE....My Face ID stopped working and I went to Apple Store to see if they could fix.  Per the technician the true depth camera is not working which cannot be fixed.  I paid $1400 for a phone that stopped working before two years.  I am extremely unhappy with Apple that no other solutions is given to fix this defective product!  The only options was to get a replacement and pay another $500 or receive a credit towards a new phone that I will still have to spend more money.

For my wife‚Äôs retirement I purchased a stainless steel Apple Watch with a $150.00 watch band. I choose this model after reading how durable it was. Spending over $700. Unknown to me apple extended the warranty to a 3year period for a problem with the back of watch falling off. I brought the watch to the apple store where it was inspected and was told that it would be covered under warranty. Minutes later I was told it would not be covered because it had been 3 years and seven months. The manager said he was not aware of the problems I was having but it didn‚Äôt matter since it was out of warranty. This problem is well documented yet I never received a notice or recall from apple so I could get it repaired during the extended warranty period. They then said I could spend $279.00 to get it fixed.  ( a new series 3 is $229 ). I feel let down buy apple and wish they would be required to notify customers of any known defects so one could get it repaired under a warranty period. I also payed $80 dollars for a iPhone 6 battery only to find out later it was also a defect under an extended warranty. One last thing. Apple employees kept referring to my watch as a damaged watch which is quite different from a defective watch. This made me feel like somehow this was my fault.,0.9199999999999999,,0.004650673400673401,,iPhone

"I am super disappointed with the fragility of the device and the numerous irritations with trying to get it serviced when broken.  It has been a fragile device which has needed several factory resets, has locked up, and failed to restore everything back from cloud storage.  Do not get this for your kids if you're not willing to spend hours helping them debug it, or if you live outside driving range of an Apple store.<br /><br />I bought the ipod touch as a birthday gift for my daughter in early November 2012.  Eight months later, it has the White Screen of Death.  She has dropped the device before, but not within weeks of its failure.  It had a protective cover.  We ran through all the technical help, did a reset to factory conditions, and nothing worked.  Watch enough YouTube videos, and the most likely problem is a tiny ribbon cable slipped out of place from its connector internally.<br /><br />So, notice that there is a 1 year warranty on the device?  It only applies to 'manufacturing defects', which pretty much only covers you if it is DOA.  If it ran for a while and then stops working, if you EVER dropped it, you're looking at a non-warranty repair.  Even if the failure did not coincide with a drop.<br /><br />Apple does not service its own devices.  It has contracted that out to another company, and Apple forwarded us to MyTechHelp.  They'll want you to pay $50 just to LOOK at it, and you have to pay $15 shipping as well, and parts will be extra.  During the call to arrange service, they talked to my wife and daughter about our wireless network and tried very hard to sell us 'management services' for the network.  I'm pretty sure my wife tried to veto every word they said about this, and she got quite frustrated with the MyTechHelp person running through their script with the hard sell.  The order confirmation e-mail states we'll owe $15/month for this service.  We can cancel it, but you have to jump through that hurdle to cancel something we never wanted in the first place.  Would you want that hassle, especially if they give you the 'let me connect you to my manager' line when you call to cancel?<br /><br />This just reeks of Apple dodging its warranty and another company making fat profits off repairs and forcing you to pay for (then cancel) services you do not agree to.<br /><br />CORRECTION: This situation smelled a little too fishy.  Googe ""Apple Customer Service"" and the top hit is the link to MyTechHelp.com.  They are not affiliated with Apple, and it's their fault we had such a bad experience.  Apple was much better about supporting the warrantee when I talked to them directly.  I changed the rating to 3 stars because the ipod has still been a trouble prone fragile device, but so far it looks like I'm getting the warranty support I expected.",0.8800000000000001,,-0.013567493112947653,,iPhone
"The mini iPad was so much easier to navigate.

"I used to be a follower of apple, from year to year I traded in my Ipod for the newest model because of their features which I found revolutionary like the 160gig Ipod, the touch screen, and the portable size Shuffle (which I used while working out). I thought they did it again with this years addition to the Ipod Touch which now has two cameras located one on the front and back just like the ones on the iphone 4g, which is advertised to take HD clarity pictures/video, I again traded my Ipod to buy this version. Once I got home and took some pictures I noticed there was something horribly wrong with the design of this ipod.<br /><br /> The first picture I took was extremely blurry, thinking it must be the lighting I tried it again and again both to the same outcome. The pictures all came out incredibly blurry so fuzzy in fact I could hardly tell what was in the photo. This clarity of picture had similar quality to those that were taken with the first cellphone/camera. I as an apple consumer will not accept this from a company who has revolutionized the field of hand held electronics. I feel like I have been let down and get the feeling that Apple now has less of an attitude to try to beat out the competition with unique design but are just relying on the loyalty of the customers to the apple brand. This fear that Apple no longer cares about impressing its customers inspired me to write this review and I hope that I can prevent this from happening to anybody else because I might save you money just because I opened the product to really check it out I owe apple $40.00 to return a product not worthy of the apple brand.",0.9,,0.04067460317460318,,iPhone

"First, shipping IS a valid review topic on Amazon, at least right at this moment, as some people will order elsewhere or even cancel an existing order based off of shipping delays.  Having said that, I will say that Amazon did get my ipod to me within the window that they had promised, and I did not pay extra.  I wish it didn't take three weeks, but I have it now and saved about $45 over what I would have paid with sales tax plus shipping elsewhere.  I am sure in the coming days or weeks this issue will be resolved by Amazon and Apple.<br /><br />There are others who have provided much more detailed reviews which I won't attempt to add to.  Let me simply say that I love the ipod having had it for less than a day.  Camera quality is acceptable for my uses.  The retina display and the faster processor are the two biggest noticable improvements for me both of which make my ipod experience much more enjoyable.<br /><br />Overall I would echo the idea of another reviewer who said that the ipod touch is really the embodiment of the promises of the computer age, full access to music, video, ebooks, email, etc etc etc.<br /><br />The one complaint that I have is I don't like the slimmer design, the 3G touch was plenty slim for me.  Due to the curvature of the sides, the volume and sleep buttons are harder to push.  Maybe I'll get used to this and it certainly isn't a dealbreaker for me.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW REGARDING SHIPPING:<br />Order placed 1 Sept, just got shipping notice & tracking number Tuesday 21 Sept.  A longer wait than I had hoped, but considering the case I ordered should arrive about the same time I think all will work out in the end.  Very happy with Amazon's price, plus no sales tax and free 2nd day shipping with Amazon Prime.  Note that Amazon upgraded to overnight shipping at no charge to me to get it to me by the promised date.<br /><br />I know I'll be happy with this unit, I was very happy with the 3rd gen.  I don't buy the ipod for the camera (that's what cameras are for!) I'm sure next years model will be even better, and I will do the same thing next year as I did this year - sell my ""old"" ipod on ebay and buy the new model.  I got nearly $300 for my ipod 3rd gen 64GB as I take good care of my stuff, so this upgrade only cost me about $100 plus $20 for a new case.<br /><br />I hope others start to see their units arriving soon.

"Day 1: Airpods pro worked just fine, both had 75% battery out of the package. Light use throughout the day. No major complaints with quality, doesn't sound unusually high quality. Interesting if not gimmicky noise transparency mode. Every single silicon ear somehow was a perfect fit according to Apple's ""check your ear canal"" technology.<br /><br />Day 2: Right earpod suddenly will not power on, Left ear works fine. Spoke with Apple Care support, they could not fix the issue. 3 hours of my life wasted.<br /><br />Waste of money. The quality control is absolutely pathetic - THERE IS NO WAY to troubleshoot your airpods via your iPhone. They are nothing like the apple watch, which has an in-house app. You hold the button on the back of the case for 15 seconds and say a prayer to RNGesus that they re-pair.

Purchased these and didn't realize till we took one on our vacation with another cord that came with our Ipad/Iphone and yes they charge but at an incredibly slow pace.

"I reserve the right to update my review.....<br /><br />First I'll start by saying that these are the best earphones I've used for working out ever....when they actually worked.  The fit is snug (regardless of ear size).  Over the course of 2 weeks, I used these earphones 2-4 hours daily.  I used them on the train, while on the eliptical (8hrs), running (20miles), and at the driving range.  When they worked, sound was great (comparable to my Bose MIE2i), build quality is great.<br /><br />One small caveat.  Music sounds great, however I tried to use them while watching netflix at the gym, and the audio seems to not be in sync and is delayed.  I personally don't think this is a Beats issue...and is more a Bluetooth downfall, but since these are the only bluetooth earphones/headphones I've had, I can not confirm that is the case.<br /><br />About 10 days after using them, I noticed that the volume down button on the inline mic stopped working.  I found this strange so I called Amazon support and called Beats support directly.  I had a lengthy conversation with Beats.  I was asked if I sweat during my workouts...which I answered yes.  I asked if that was an issue, and they proceeded to say no, and that they are sweat resistant (not sure why they asked then).  I un-paired the earphones with both my iPhone and iPad and re-paired them with my iPhone and PRESTO...the volume buttom started to work again.<br /><br />2 days later, the volume up and down stopped working.  I figured I had found the solution and just needed to re-pair them to my iphone.  I turned off the earphones, un-paired from my phone and then tried to re-pair them...but to my surprise...I was unable to turn them back on.  I've attempted to charge them, but haven't had any success getting them to turn on.<br /><br />I'm hoping I just received a bad version of these earphones as I am exchanging them and purchasing them again.  I want to like them...and I will give them the benefit of the doubt, so I plan on trying them again.<br /><br />I will update my review after I receive the new earphones.  Stay tuned.....",0.82,,0.11569420917247003,,iPhone

Since my job has me flying at least 2 times a week I have searing for a great headphone to fly with. I must admit I was kinda weary about purchasing these headphones after reading the reviews. But I must say I am very glad that I got these headphones. Yes they are a bit heavy but hey they are made from metal and not cheap plastic. I was first in the airport and using them while waiting for my flight and listening to music on my iPhone 5 and a phone call came in. The noise cancellation was perfect and I could just a hear my call and nothing around. The only slight problem was that the mic was very loud as my girlfriend would describe. The inflight experience was the best I've had! The noise cancellation drowned out the jet engine noises and provided excellent sound. On the plane I watch movies from my iPad and the headphones made me feel like I was at the movies. I could hear every sound a from leaves falling to rain drops. I was very impressed and I will never fly without them! If you're a frequent flier like myself this is a must have.,0.78,,0.3191228070175439,,iPhone
"Noise cancellation is great for concentration. The bass sounds a little flat though when using it with an iPhone and Spotify.

"There is a problem with this computer and monitors. When the computer goes into energy save mode, it may take a long time do ""wake up"" again. This is a known issue. Just check the Apple Support pages, or make a Google search with the words 'Mac Mini monitor sleep mode' or something similar. I find it strange that I haven't seen any reviews in this site mentioning this problem.<br /><br />In my case the problem is not only that the monitor won't come out of sleep mode: worse than that, it would enter sleep mode EVEN WHILE I WAS TYPING. I was using the HDMI - DVI adpater that came with the Mac Mini, plus a DVI cable I bought at Best Buy. I tried with three different monitors, one from LG, one from Dell and the other from HP, with the same result. Sometimes I could work for hours without any problem, but sometimes the monitor would go black in my face three or four times in ten minutes.<br /><br />I live in Brasil, and I bought the Mac Mini in the US, so I have no warranty. I ordered a mini Display Port to VGA adapter from Apple in Brazil, to see if it would solve the problem. Well, it didn't. I changed the setting to make the monitor enter sleep mode after a few minutes (I had changed it to ""never""), let the monitor go into sleep and couldn't make it wake up again. I had to access the computer via VNC from my iPhone, turn it off and then turn it on again to be able to use it again.<br /><br />I've been using the VGA adapter since yesterday, and at least until now the monitor has never entered sleep mode while I was working. I don't know if it will stay this way, because, as I said above, the problem is intermittent. As it is now, I'm using the VGA adapter and I configured the computer to never put the monitor in sleep mode. It is not ideal, but I can live with that.<br /><br />The Mac Mini has a good price and the design is very nice. I'm new to Mac OS and the track pad, and it has been fun working with them. But I think this issue with the monitors is serious. And it has been happening for some time, and Apple apparently doesn't care. I've been working in the IT sector of a company with more than a thousand employees for several years, and in all this time I have never known of a computer that wasn't able to present images in a monitor. So I cannot give the Mac Mini more than two stars.",0.8400000000000001,,0.10910658307210032,,iPhone

"Let me preface by saying that I am a loyal apple customer. I have completely bought in to the elegant, easy to use, convenient, outrageously priced, company that is Apple. I have the latest Apple Watch, MacBook Pro, iPad, Apple pencil, and iPhone. And I am here to tell you that the AirPods pro are NOT WORTH IT!<br /><br />I'll start with the good: These headphones have very good noise cancelling. It baffles me how Apple was able to produce such great noise cancelling technology in an in-ear headphone. They also have transparency mode which is almost better than not wearing any headphones at all. You can hear yourself and your surroundings clear as day and all it takes to switch between the two is holding the stem for 2 seconds. The sound quality is also great. At least, when the headphone actually stays in your ear. Theres good balance and you feel completely immersed in the music. I also like the new system for pausing/unpausing sound. It is more assuring to hear a button click than praying that you tapped in the right spot on the right bud (which is what the original AirPods required).  However despite the great engineering that went into these headphones, I do not recommend buying them!<br /><br />When I first fitted them in my ear they felt snug and the ear fitting gauge said the medium ones were perfect. Since then, I don't know if my ears have somehow stretched or what happened but the AirPods now fall out ALL THE TIME. I do wear them for long periods of time and they are usually comfortable for the first 30 minutes, but then my inner ear flaps start aching in pain. They have fallen out multiple times while I'm sitting at my desk not moving, and don't even get me started on what its like to exercise in them (lets just say as soon as there is any sweat it's game over). I know you're probably thinking ""Why don't you just put a bigger earpiece on?"" Nope. I will never do that again. If the pain from the medium earpiece is annoying, the bigger earpiece is unbearable.<br /><br />Not only are they uncomfortable, but they also die way faster than the original air-pods! This is probably due to the fact that I use them in noise canceling or transparency mode exclusively, but let me explain. I bought the AirPods Pro because I wanted portable noise-canceling headphones. If I was okay with non-noise cancelling, then I would have just stuck witch my original AirPods and saved $250+!  I can usually wear these for 3.5-4 hours before they die whereas my original AirPods would last 7 hours easily.<br /><br />While the noise canceling is amazing, my original AirPods (and even regular headphones) do fine job of blocking out external noise when the music is lout enough. i would choose comfortable headphone that get the job done over super uncomfortable ones with real noise canceling. I also think there are much more comfortable noise canceling headphones on the market such as Beats and Bose over ear headphones.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I gave my original AirPods to a friend and dislike these AirPods Pro so much that I have reverted to OG chorded apple headphones. I suffered for 4 weeks. I was in denial that this investment could be so not worth it. But I finally caved and I'm so glad thatI did because I am so much happier using my $20 headphones than the $250 AirPods Pro.<br /><br />The original AirPods are great! I used them every single day. They are convenient, comfortable, and very compatible with my other devices. Unfortunately the AirPods Pro have been a major loss for me. Yes they do have unbelievable noise cancelling and transparency technology along with a great sound, but they are UNCOMFORTABLE and do not work for my daily life. Please save $100 and get the original AirPods! I wish I had mine back!",0.96,,0.2030937385907265,,iPhone

"I received them as a gift and I love them for working out.  They fit great, sound great and they stay on your ears with little to no movement.<br /><br />Now the downside(and it's a BIG downside)...the quality is crap.  I've had them for two months and I've had to send them back to Apple because the Play/Pause and the Volume down buttons stopped working.  Apple sent me a new pair.  These headphones cost way too much to have to worry about them breaking down in less than 2 months.<br /><br />Also, the Bluetooth connection isn't that great.  When they're connected to my phone(Samsung & iPhone), I can't keep my phone in my pocket because the connection goes in and out.  Even the replacement pair that Apple gave me have the same problem.  I've had cheaper Bluetooth headphones never had connection issues like this.<br /><br />If you're seriously looking at Powerbeats, I would suggest going with the wired pair.

"I recently purchased the Apple USB-C to Lightning Cable (2 m) and am thrilled with its performance. This cable has exceeded my expectations regarding speed, durability, and overall quality.<br /><br />Firstly, the length of the cable is perfect for my needs. At 2 meters, charging my Apple devices without staying next to the wall socket gives me plenty of flexibility. This is incredibly convenient when I am working on my laptop and need to charge my iPhone or iPad simultaneously.<br /><br />Moreover, the cable is high-speed at charging my devices. I was blown away by how quickly it captured my iPhone 12 and was even more impressed with the speed of charging my iPad Pro. The USB-C to Lightning technology is genuinely a game-changer regarding charging times.<br /><br />In terms of durability, this cable is built to last. The braided design of the line gives it a strong and sturdy feel, which gives me peace of mind that it won't easily break or fray like other cables I've used in the past. In addition, the Lightning connector is securely attached to the line and fits perfectly into my devices without looseness or wobbling.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend the Apple USB-C to Lightning Cable (2 m) to anyone who wants a high-quality and reliable charging cable for their Apple devices. It may be more expensive than other cables on the market, but the superior performance, durability, and convenience of this cable make it well worth the investment.",0.96,17.0,0.32750000000000007,0.65175,iPad

"This is my first Ipad ever and I am very happy so far. What tipped the scales for me were the pencil and keyboard for this lower priced model. I have been using the pencil a lot. I find it easier to scroll up and down a page using the pencil than your finger. Also I really enjoy being able to hand write notes in GoodNotes5. It's already been very useful when I took this to a conference and had the course materials on PDF and could highlight and put notes all over the PDF while others carried a 600 page binder. One could definitely use this as a replacement to carrying a bunch of files. I feel there is not much lost in writing on Ipad compared to paper. Now feel, it's of course a different feel and you can get the paper like product but I did not because I did not want to lose any resolution and vividness from the screen. The control is good and no delay. I've also enjoyed using it to paint and draw using a different app. I have not used the keyboard as much, but I have to write a few different emails and papers. It works as a fine screen protector and then you can whip out the keyboard as needed. It's an ok keyboard but probably not what you'd want to write a ton on as it's not super ergonomic and the keys might not be everyone's preference. The battery life is good. The size is pretty good. I can see how the bigger screen models would be nice especially for more room to write on. This model works perfect for me. If you were in between needing an Ipad and a laptop, I might recommend you go for the pro which with the more powerful processor and bigger screen, could fit that bill. It would be nice to have a mouse pad and an arrow on the screen though but using the pencil or my finger I've been able to edit and get where I need to on the screen pretty well.

"Firstly, $199 is about what I'm willing to pay for this and what Apple should have priced it originally IMO. I've been using my Logitech Folio Touch (LFT) as I think it is the ""other"" must have accessory to the iPad Pro. But it has its drawbacks, much like the Magic Keyboard (MK) does. There are trade-offs in having each. The LFT's main flaw (and the reason I got the MK) is it's kick stand. While I understand there is an advantage to it without writing a full review about it, the LFT's form factor takes up too much desktop space and is not as ""lappable"" as the MK. If you want a closer form factor to a real laptop, the MK is the clear choice. The overall build quality, especially the keyboard keys and track pad are top notch. The extra USB C port for charging is a great added convenience. However, as I mentioned, the MK isn't perfect by any means as I do miss the extra row of function buttons. The MK doesn't offer as much protection as the LFT does. Also, the material used for the MK is also too prone to finger prints and dust.<br /><br />Ultimately I can live the flaws of the MK more than the LFT as the prices I paid are closer between the two. I'll most likely sell the LFT.<br /><br />Easy recommendation for the Magic Keyboard at $199. If the price stayed anything over that, I'd be perfectly happy in sticking with the LFT.",0.96,299.0,0.2961212121212122,0.5948310289561798,iPad

"I ordered this refurbished through a secondhand seller, and firstly want to say that it cam in a condition that was as if it were brand new.  If you have an IPad that you use as a productivity device, this is an essential accessory.  2 years ago I had the Ipad air 2019 and the Logitech crayon (as the air only supported the first gen Apple Pencil at the time).  While the Logitech Crayon was effective for writing, and did create a desirable experience, this is far superior, as this is better integrated and more customizable to your needs.  The writing experience as well is just *chef‚Äôs kiss* perfection.  The only con I have is that despite its functional integration with the iPad, there still isn‚Äôt much of a means of securing it with the iPad.  The magic keyboard has no holster for it, and the magnet on the side is insufficient when putting the unit into a bag.  The pencil always falls away into the dark caverns within my bag.

"Never before did I think I would pay so much for a case/keyboard for a tablet but I thought I would treat myself and get it for my iPad Air 4.  Apple is sometimes known for form over function but in this case they got both right.  Typing is a pleasure for a smaller keyboard and the tactile feel is superb.  The way the tablet lifts out and angles from a closed position is just perfect for me; there is almost no need for readjusting.  Add to that the sleep/wake function, which most of those inexpensive bluetooth keyboards and separate cases don't offer unless the keyboard is removed (which kind of defeats the purpose, in my opinion), and I have a winner.

"I got the Apple Pencil for use with my iPad Air 4.  I like the Apple Pencil, I really do.  It works great for my note taking I do for work.  I don't really draw, but I tried that briefly and it seemed to work well too.<br /><br />I think the big question is, is it worth the full retail price?  I think the answer is, it depends.  If you like to draw on an iPad then I think it's probably absolutely worth it.  The pressure sensitivity seems to work well and it's comfortable to hold and use.<br /><br />If you just want it for note taking and a little doodling now and then, then it's probably not worth the full price to you.  This could also depend on how many notes you are taking though.  It might be absolutely worth it if you are a student and take tons of notes, but in general, most people probably don't need to spend the money on the pencil.<br /><br />If you aren't drawing and just are focused on note taking I would look at the Logitech pencil.  It doesn't have the pressure sensitivity, but it should work fine for note taking.<br /><br />I gave the Apple Pencil 4 stars because I don't think it's a must have accessory and I think it's a little over priced for what it does.

It came as described and working great! No scratches! The only warning is that the case has ZERO protection for your iPad so be careful when using it.

"After buying a new M2 iPad Pro (11‚Äù), I wanted to also get a keyboard for it. Along with a Apple Pencil. After looking at Logitech, which I would likely recommend over this for the price.

"I love mechanical keyboards, so when my job decided it was time to start working in the office again, I knew I had to get a good TKL wireless keyboard to keep in my office. Since this is staying at work, I didn't want to build something, or spend a whole lot of money on it. So after doing some Reddit research, I decided on this Royal Kludge model. I really wasn't expecting much, but holy cow! This thing is so good for how little it costs!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Feels heavy and sturdy<br />Battery life is excellent, especially with RGB off.<br />Good wireless range. I've tested both 2.4ghz and bluetooth with no issues<br />Probably the best stock ABS keycaps I've received on any keyboard. They are thick and not overly clacky<br />RK Brown switches are better than I expected. If you're a keyboard enthusiast, these will annoy you, but normal users should be totally happy with these switches.<br />Backlighting is nice and bright<br />Built in back feet for adjusting angle.<br />Removable bezel is a nice touch. Not something I will likely use, but a nice touch nonetheless<br /><br />Cons:<br />Stabilizers are just ok, not great. A little rattley, could definitely benefit from modding.<br />Instruction manual is... not great.<br />RGB is limited, and not great quality.<br />Software - it works, but is a little clunky. Also, I didn't see anywhere on this page or the instructions that said you have to be in wired mode to use the software, but you do.<br />Software (again) - you have to download it from Google drive. I understand hosting costs money, but come on, that's the sketchiest possible way to distribute software. I can attest though, after thorough testing, that the software is clean and totally safe.<br /><br />Overall I'm incredibly impressed.

"Finally splurged for this pencil after using soft tipped, non-accurate stylus‚Äôs for years. Below is my feedback.

"I love this thing. If you have the right hardware for it (I have a 2020 iPad Air) then this will open up a whole new world of iPad use to you. I always drew on paper and never enjoyed art on tablets. Now I can draw on my iPad and it feels as natural as drawing on paper. And because the web is now the same size as it is on regular computers now, it can sometimes be hard to hit small links on web pages. The Apple Pencil lets me more easily navigate around web pages and hit those tiny boxes to close ads.<br /><br />I find myself using the pencil instead of my finger for almost everything on the iPad now. Being able to write directly in text boxes in any app is awesome. It takes about a day for the iPad to learn your handwriting and get what you're writing correct on the first try but once it learns your handwriting the Scribble feature works great.<br /><br />Of course there are times when using the keyboard or just navigating with your fingers is more natural but it's always great to have this pencil for art and for casual use as well. It's an accessory I thought I would only use for drawing but I use it more and more for just about everything now. The fact that it never runs out of battery and magnetically attaches to the side of my iPad makes it so I never have to remember to bring it with me because it's just a part of the iPad now.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone.

"I really wanted to love this keyboard. I buy every new version of the Pro iPad. I always have the pencil and keyboard cover. Truth is, I seldom use the cover as a keyboard. When I do, it is more than fine. When I use the iPad w pencil it‚Äôs usually to markup word docs, draw, and sketch. I find this most comfortable with a naked tablet.

Love it for the versatility and ease of use. Love it for the featherweight. Love the ecosystem. But recognize, this is just not a laptop. A $300 keyboard that makes your iPad 2.5x heavier and not much more powerful‚Äî-tough sell. I promise, I am not dissing the magic keyboard.

"This keyboard/touch pad is more of a desktop accessory than a case/keyboard/touch pad. As a keyboard and touch pad it works well apart form the difficulty in reaching the upper row of keys when the iPad is attached. The keyboard is nicely weighted and responsive and the track pad is well integrated, almost making you believe you are using a real computer. Almost but not there. iOS apps are nowhere near as functional as their MacOS counterparts.<br /><br />The biggest issue is that you cannot use this as a case. Using the iPad without keyboard requires you to remove the keyboard. It also adds a lot of weight and bulk to the iPad. So if you carry your iPad around and use it without the keyboard for some of the time, and then want a keyboard occasionally, this is not the solution. You should use the the Smart Keyboard and not the Magic Keyboard. The Smart Keyboard does not have the track pad, but it folds up so you can use the iPad easily without the keyboard and arrange it to use the Smart Keyboard without removing the iPad.<br /><br />As long as you understand its limitations this is a fine accessory, but is it not the portable accessory that you can take with you anywhere, there are better and less costly solutions.",0.96,299.0,0.2450793650793651,0.5693101054352562,iPad
"Be aware! This requires a lightening cable. Those of us without iPhones might not have one, and the one that Amazon throws in with the refurbished keyboards is 4&#34; long.

"Yes, I want to start by saying that Apple could have been more straightforward in saying that the wall charging block needs to be USB-C and at least 20W.<br />The original iPhone small ""square"" block was 2W, maybe 5W if my memory is correct.<br />The iPad charging block at the wall is 12W.<br /><br />I have been using 15-20W charging blocks and USB-C to Lightning for various uses since I got my 12 Pro Max.<br />It is an inconvenience to have to get a 20W charging block to go along with this, but to free up the lightning port and have it stick to the back is a luxury, not to mention that I have at least 2 20W or higher blocks, and people who bought a phone that was this expensive, having to spend $20 should not be surprising or overwhelming by any amount. USB-A cannot carry this much power, and so a USB-C wall block paired with this Magsafe Charger really is something special.<br /><br />I don't think that so many highly rated reviews stating $20 ruined the product should be what people focus on.

Let me start by saying that I didn‚Äôt buy the Magic Keyboard on Amazon only because I don‚Äôt like $350 packages left on my front porch. That being said I debated spending this much on a keyboard. I had already had a clamshell case with keyboard that suited my needs and worked well. But I was intrigued by the floating look of the iPad on the keyboard and liked that it seemed to be a little closer to my face because of that. So I took the plunge and I‚Äôm glad I did. Part of the problem with my clamshell was that if I wanted to play games I had to turn the whole darn thing on it‚Äôs side because it was too much to take the iPad out of the case. Not now. I just pop the iPad off the magnetic holder and all is good. It also took a few seconds to ‚Äúwake‚Äù up my old keyboard to start typing and that was a little annoying.  I love that the iPad snaps on to this one and away you go. The keys are nice and springy and travel well. The backlight feature is especially nice. All in all I think it‚Äôs a winner.

"Overall this keyboard is very nice. It‚Äôs good for a desk or kitchen counter. This makes the iPad useful like a laptop. The benefit is that you don‚Äôt have to worry about connecting to Bluetooth and the keyboard instantly connects and works. The keyboard and trackpad are great although the trackpad‚Äôs small size can be limiting. I don‚Äôt think this is good for people who want to use the iPad as a tablet and as a laptop. The price is high and you‚Äôll probably want a separate case when using it as a tablet. The iPad is very slippery to hold without a case. This keyboard hinge can‚Äôt be rotated past 90 degrees. The hinge stops in place once it‚Äôs open to the angle shown. It‚Äôs not like a laptop screen that can fold back almost flat or like some keyboards that fold into tablet mode. This keyboard adds weight but no battery. The screen has zero adjustment. It literally has one position. It is also a nuisance to fiddle with the pencil. Great concept to have it charge with iPad but you‚Äôll become annoyed by it when you aren‚Äôt using it. I‚Äôd prefer it to lock into the case to charge and I might use the keyboard as a dock. This iPad keyboard combo is top heavy as well so best suited for a desk or flat surface. The main hinge only allows for one position (open or closed) and the second has two positions bad and good. I prefer my older iPad Pro in a nice leather case with the origami style folding cover. I think if I had that with a keyboard that clipped onto it and also charged and held the pencil would better fit my use. Also the ads make it look so easy to snap it on and off the keyboard but putting it on is either two hands or you have to grip it in just the right place to keep your fingers out of the way. I‚Äôll update once I live with it for awhile but first impressions is the look and build are great but the functions seems limited. A MacBook Air and an iPad for drawing almost make more sense but obviously depending on your budget and workflow this might be something to consider. Definitely test it out before buying.<br /><br />Unrelated note, I really like the previous generation keyboard with the fabric over the keys. I like that it allowed the keyboard to keep dust out of the cracks. It lacked the touchpad and backlight and had a strange folding design. I would buy that keyboard as a stand alone wireless keyboard but unfortunately it only works with the connection that required the iPad to be attached to the case.",0.96,299.0,0.20092384887839437,0.5472323473347709,iPad

"Got this for my iPad Air. It‚Äôs literally twice the weight of the iPad itself, but that‚Äôs necessary to offset the weight of the iPad when open.<br /><br />The texture and feel is great. I always worry that debris or random dirt that finds its way to my surfaces may damage or scratch something like this. So far, so good though.<br /><br />Didn‚Äôt even realize or think about the fact that it has a pass through charging port, which is nice? I don‚Äôt use my iPad in long enough sessions that I would need to charge while using it. So the port on the keyboard case is just a slightly more convenient location to charge from while it‚Äôs folded and tucked on my desk.<br /><br />I‚Äôm big into the tactile feel of keyboard and I enjoy typing.

"I'm used to Apple's accessories being a little overpriced but this product is way too expensive for what you get. I would not recommend it for the full $300 at all.<br /><br />I personally got it on sale for $200 and I feel that's what I would have expected it to be in the first place (Still overpriced, but not nearly as ridiculous).<br /><br />I think the biggest problem with this product is that it's not the most versatile. You either need to use it as a stand or take the iPad off of the case. However being able to easily take the iPad off is exactly what I like most about this case. I love using my iPad as a tablet without a case on it, but also love to have a laptop-like experience when needed.<br /><br />Personally my biggest complaint is the material of the case. It feels bad to me and I know that many have issues with it peeling. I don't know why they're still making cases with this material, especially given its price.<br /><br />Now for the good stuff! The trackpad is just a little too small vertically but there's not much they can do to fix that. The trackpad's texture feels fine and the clicking feels nice. You can click anywhere on the trackpad no problem. Overall I am satisfied with the trackpad.<br /><br />The keyboard is fantastic. It feels great and isn't too small.<br /><br />Overall I do not regret purchasing this case. It works well for my use.

"By far the nicest looking case you can buy for this phone.

Never interferes with any screen protectors and gives the phone a ton of grip! The bottom is left exposed, mainly to avoid the sound from the speakers to be compromised. If you ever drop it from a decent height or onto a rough surface, it will put a nice gash into the case.

The wrinkling issue is a real problem with all Apple folio products I have purchased and the Smart Keyboard for the iPad Pro 12.9.  You would think that Apple could produce a better product for the price.  I think they should put part of their packaging expense into producing a filing and keyboard that does not wrinkle.  The smart keyboard also has an issue with electrical failure at the hinge.

"Let me be clear, I am not an Apple fan in the slightest. All of my other devices are either Android or PC, and all of my accessories are non-Apple as well, and I don't intend to convert everything to Apple even after trying out this iPad. However, THIS TABLET IS AN AMAZING TOOL FOR DIGITAL ARTISTS. No lag from the Apple Pencil, the iPadOS system is incredibly efficient and you get access to great apps like Procreate. Battery life is really impressive; with heavy use I only have to charge it every other day or so. Outside of creative apps, it doesn't really show any lag even when you're using the iPad heavily and switching in and out of apps/multi-tasking. I completely intend to carry my iPad only now instead of a laptop, as it's much lighter and it does everything I need it to do. Perhaps it's because I only had experience with Android tablets before, and I was really not impressed by those because they're basically just really big Android phones. The iPad definitely showcases the potential of a proper tablet (although with the way the iPad Pros are going, perhaps they want to incorporate more PC functions in it in the long run).<br /><br />PROs:<br />-iPadOS is quite efficient, and combined with the tablet's processor and memory, it's very fast.<br />-For digital artists, this is basically a Wacom MobileStudio for a fraction of the price, and even more portable because Procreate opens up instantly, and you're ready to draw in a second. Add a matte screen protector, and the drawing experience is even better.<br />-Screen size is actually very portable, and I can hold it in my hands or lap like a notebook very easily.<br />-Apple pencil is very responsive, no lag, very nice sensitivity<br />-Nice screen resolution and brightness<br />-Long battery life<br />-Multi-tasking functions make the tablet feel more like a PC, and with the Files app, importing and exporting files is not much of a problem.<br />-has the ability to hook up to external devices like hard drives and flash drives<br />-Access to many well-designed applications<br /><br />CONs<br />-Really wish it had the iPad Pro/second gen Apple Pencil feature where the Apple Pencil magnetically attaches to the tablet and charges wirelessly; the ipad 7 is only compatible with the first generation Apple Pencil, which needs to be uncapped and plugged into the tablet to charge. Fortunately, the Apple Pencil can reach a full charge pretty quickly.<br />-need an adapter to hook up external devices that are not already USB-C.<br />-I'm 120% sure Apple knew what they were doing by offering a 32 GB and a 128 GB version (32 GB feels like it's barely enough, while 128 GB is more than enough; the 128 GB is $100 more, which I think is kind of absurd), but I think the ideal storage size might have been 64 GB.<br /><br />And not really a con, but as a primarily Android/PC user it definitely took a while to learn all of the multi-tasking gestures and functions. iPadOS definitely runs on a lot of touch gestures, while Android tablets don't have anywhere near as much gestures/functions.",0.96,389.48,0.18230555555555558,0.5246946469981439,iPad

"If there were competing products for this device, I would quickly consider them, but in evaluating knock-off replacements none of them had the featureset of this pen to even be considered in the realm of competitive.

Yes it's nice it has dual speakers, but noticed that when holding the Ipad Mini 6 on the bottom, I would cover up the speakers and the sound was muffled. It has Center Stage, which is nice; but I don't or rarely use the front or rear camera than the occasional FB Messenger vid chat with my kids. I think tablet should not have a rear camera at all, hardly do I know people to ever use them.<br /><br />I returned the Ipad Mini 6 and picked up a brand new Ipad Mini 5, 256gb storage at a local brick and mortar computer store in Southern California. I saw on their website that they had one left of the said Ipad Mini 5 in Space Gray, the color I wanted. I went to pick it up and the box was still wrapped in its clear plastic and as brand new as it can be. It was the only one and I bought it for $380, instead of when it was new at $550.<br /><br />Yes, it's an older Ipad Mini with the wider forehead and chin bezels, but I actually don't mind. I guess I like the ""retro"" look. To me it makes sense that the bezels are wider, I don't get finger smudges on the actual screen. The clarity of the screen is real good and it can get plenty bright when maxed out. I keep it at 50% brightness and it's still quite bright. The battery lasts quite a long time, a few days worth; even for an Ipad Mini that I guess was just sitting on the stores back shelf and did not get sold. I'm guessing since this was the last Ipad Mini 5 they have and happened to be the 256gb storage and the new Ipad Mini 6 came out, they dropped the price; even less than a new Ipad Mini 6 with 64gb storage, new at $500!<br /><br />The fingerprint scanner on the Ipad Mini 5 works much, much better at reading both my thumb fingerprints. I would say it recognizes either thumb 90-95% of the time and that is way cool!<br /><br />It is easier to type on the screen keyboard on the Ipad Mini 5, granted I'm using both my index fingers to type but it is easier and more accurate than with a bigger Ipad. Just wish they had swipe on the screen keyboard. I gotta see if there is an app for this.<br /><br />I bought a 65w external USB C charger and bought an Lightning to USB C cable. The 65w charger, charges the Mini 5 quite fast from 10% to 100% in just under 2 hours. I did ask if it was safe to use the 65w external charger for an Ipad that the block charger is rated for 20w. And the answer I got was yes. It is safe to use the 65w external charger with my Ipad Mini 5.<br /><br />I did install an anti-glare screen protector since the screen on this tablet and any other tablet is too glossy for my liking. So much easier to see the screen and no glare!<br /><br />I'm okay with the Lightning connector, it works for me. I did like the USB C connector on the Ipad Mini 6 but that was it.<br /><br />Maybe if Apple updates the Ipad MIni 6 to something a bit better in the next iteration, I may get that. Till then, this Ipad Mini 5 is my travel companion.!",0.9199999999999999,289.69,0.1729236812570146,0.5225934243852235,iPad

"Yes the price is amazing 160$ ‚ÄúAmazon certified refurbished ‚Äú  I have bought TVs from Amazon the same way and have never had any issues, so I thought this was a good idea. However right out of the box the iPad would not charge properly including with the charger it came with. I tried multiple certified Amazon charging cords and docks.

My time is precious and I want the actual iPad not the refund. I am looking at the Amazon guarantee that was included with the iPad saying it would be replaced if I wasn‚Äôt happy with the 90 days. Now magically the iPad is not available and the only thing Amazon can do is give me a credit. What about the man hours I put in setting it up?  Now I have to wipe it, wrap it up, and send it back?

"Really, there is nothing different to write about this keyboard. The keyboard like any other apple device, is extremely expensive but it does what its supposed to do without any hiccups.<br /><br />It is heavy, thick, bit that is not necessarily a bad thing. It adds some depth and stability to the iPad Pro, especially the 11 inch. (The one I am typing this on). Typing on this relatively small keyboard is enjoyable and a lot more accurate than my 13 laptop, not because of the keyboard, even thought the key travel is excellent and there is not enough that could be desired for there. What makes this fairly accurate is the predictive correction. After using this keyboard, I wonder why not all the PC‚Äôs use this type of predictive word correction when it comes to typing emails. Could save us a lot of hours.<br /><br />The touchpad makes this elevate to the next level. I like it, because how smooth and natural it feels while using it. I seldom want to use the touchscreen after this. The trackpad has a lot of touch gestures.<br /><br />The biggest CON for the the 11 users is that, you have no protection if you decide to use this thing in the bed. Unless you like the idea of the keyboard stand resting on your belly. A secondary folio type case is the must. I wish this could turn backwards or something, or sort of a silicone sock like thing which could used while snapping the iPad on and off from the keyboard dock.<br /><br />It is intuitive, it is nice, it works, and its smooth And it even adds a level of protection to the iPad (I dropped mine once with the keyboard folio on and it survived just fine). The one thing it is not ‚Äùaffordable‚Äù.<br /><br />I am returning mine due to its price tag.",0.96,299.0,0.14444444444444446,0.5189926451177959,iPad
"First, let me say this product is overpriced for what it is - it is very thin plastic shell, that offers very little protection for the iPad on its own. It‚Äôs greatest selling point, however, is the pencil holder that keeps your pencil securely in place while still allowing you to maintain the magnetic charge to the pencil. I loved it so much, when I bought my daughter a new iPad Pro, I didn‚Äôt hesitate to order another CoverBuddy for her as well (because I don‚Äôt want her to lose her Apple Pencil!!)<br /><br />Not long after ordering the second cover for my daughter, I started getting weird errors on my iPad saying that my keyboard wasn‚Äôt a recognized device. (It is a genuine Apple Magic Keyboard, so that made no sense...) Then I noticed I wasn‚Äôt always able to charge the iPad using the port that‚Äôs built into the hinge of the keyboard (which I preferred using because it was more convenient to my power outlet in my workspace than the port on the iPad itself when it is connected to the keyboard.) Then my keyboard stopped working altogether.<br /><br />At first, I thought the keyboard was broken, but then I realized that one of the little rivets on the CoverBuddy that allows the keyboard to connect to the iPad fell out, so it was preventing the keyboard from communicating with the iPad.<br /><br />I was super bummed because I think one of Apple‚Äôs greatest oversights when designing the 2nd generation of Apple Pencil is that the magnetic connection for the pencil is not strong enough to keep it in place when putting the iPad in my purse, for example, and that‚Äôs why I loved the CoverBuddy most of all. Basically, it is a $46 pencil holder.<br /><br />Now, the same exact problem has happened to my daughter‚Äôs CoverBuddy. And without a secure way to connect the Apple Pencil, I‚Äôm sure it is going to get lost. So disappointing!<br /><br />Fortunately, I just found a product called Thankscase for $15 that seems like it‚Äôll serve the same purpose. It isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúcase‚Äù, but to be honest, I rarely take the iPad off the Magic Keyboard anyway, plus I have a glass protector on the screen as well. The CoverBuddy really never offered significant protection as a case anyway. I don‚Äôt know how secure this Thankscase is, or how seamlessly it integrates with the iPad design, but the price difference means I definitely won‚Äôt be buying another CoverBuddy.<br /><br />I am sorry to leave a negative review, but $46 (x2, in my case!) is just too expensive for a product that only seems to last 6 months to a year (and is really not much more than a pencil holder.) I initially thought it was clever engineering, but if it doesn‚Äôt work, it just doesn‚Äôt work. :(",0.96,299.0,0.1442540197897341,0.5188974327904408,iPad

"I ordered this Apple Pencil in anticipation for my new IPad Air 4 back in March 2021. It was marked as ‚Äúnew‚Äù, I paid full price ($130). It worked fantastically for most of the next 17 months. When the pencil was not in my hand, it was attached to the side of my iPad Air 4. It kept a 100% charge all the time when I wasn‚Äôt using it. I draw in Procreate, Illustrator, and Photoshop and I am an avid note taker so I‚Äôm always aware of the battery level of both devices.<br /><br />I always plugged my iPad in every night to charge or at my desk first thing in the morning while I worked. I always checked the Pencil. If it was ever detached for whatever reason, I connected it and observed it was at or near 100% every time. A few minutes later it was back to a full charge.<br /><br />Fast forward to August 2022.  The Apple Pencil suddenly stopped charging. Over the next few days, it failed to charge and died for the first time. It would intermittently charge. Every few days, it appeared to charge to 100% and seemed to be fine. A few days of sporadic use I would notice the Apple Pencil was not charging (I still kept the Pencil attached and the iPad charged). Then magically it would charge again after forgetting the Pencil and reconnecting several times. Then it would sporadically not maintain a charge.<br /><br />I was busy with a lot of important projects during this time so this was low priority in my life. Finally at the last week of September it refused to charge at all. It would charge enough to connect via Bluetooth (only briefly) then disconnect.<br /><br />I took it and my iPad to the local Best Buy (an Apple Authorized Service Provider) and they diagnosed it with a bad battery that would not charge. The tech asked me when I purchased the Pencil and I indicated ‚ÄúMarch 2021‚Äù so he was checking for any warranty that may be active. He checked the Serial Number against an Apple database and told me it was originally purchased in January 2021.<br /><br />I bought a new Pencil and got a used Pencil? It seemed to work fine for over a year. But I‚Äôm left wondering why it suddenly stopped charging? What could‚Äôve been wrong with it to have the Pencil last for so long then stop working? Are Apple Pencils notorious for just not being a good product?<br /><br />Granted, I had the device for one year and a number of months but I did not expect it to crap out on me so quickly. I have a 15 year old Wacom stylus and tablet that still work. I have an iPhone 6S Max that still works (not my daily driver, but still). My 37 year old NES works like it‚Äôs 1985. I take great care of my technology.<br /><br />I took care of it and followed the directions (especially didn‚Äôt get it wet or feed it after midnight). I took it on vacation this summer and it stayed in the room. Not even around water or sand. Yet here was a $130 aluminum and plastic stick that was useless. Like a fool, I did not purchase an Apple Care plan for the Pencil (my mistake). And it was apparently used when I bought it. Amazon lied.<br /><br />I spent $130 on another one at Best Buy that day (much to the chagrin from my wife) and I shouldn‚Äôt have had to do that. I could see if I treated it poorly and did not keep it charged but that was not the case.<br /><br />Amazon sold me a used Pencil that may have had a defect. I double checked my order to make sure I did not buy a refurbished or used Pencil (I did not).

"There is a lot to like about the Magic Keyboard for 5th Gen. iPad Pros. It's a solid, well-built product that is probably too expensive by half, but I'm pretty sure anyone who purchases one knows that going in.<br /><br />Keyboard: The keyboard is pretty-great all around. I use my M1 MacBook Pro on a daily basis, and while typing on this doesn't feel quite identical, it isn't far off. The key travel is really great and the space/size is perfect. I wish it had a row of function keys, alas.<br /><br />Trackpad: The trackpad is nice enough. It is very responsive both in terms of moving the cursor and clicking on apps and tasks. I do wish that more apps utilized gestures and features of the Magic Keyboard, but I can't really fault the product for that. It's not MacOS, after all.<br /><br />Quality: I really like the quality of this keyboard. It is slightly thicker than the previous gen keyboard to accommodate the slightly thicker 5th gen iPad Pro.

"After trying several aftermarket keyboard cases for my 2nd-gen 12.9 inch iPad Pro, I ended up coming right back to Apple‚Äôs original Smart Keyboard cover.  The other keyboard cases were all too heavy or bulky, or couldn‚Äôt be used comfortably in portrait mode.  Also, most 3rd-party keyboard cases are also Bluetooth-based, which caused lags or non-responsive keys.  The Apple Smart Keyboard connected seamlessly with my iPad Pro right out of the box, and its slim profile and light weight makes it easy to carry in one hand with this cover on.  However, one downside of the Smart Keyboard is that the keys aren‚Äôt backlit, which makes it challenging to type in the dark.  Another minus is that it only covers the front screen of the iPad, so it won‚Äôt protect the device from damage if it‚Äôs dropped or scratched on the back.  To fill this gap, Apple sells a silicone rear case, but there are several good quality back cases offered by 3rd-party manufacturers that do the job for a fraction of the price.<br /><br />Grade: B+",0.78,86.94,0.1759834368530021,0.5117661984879067,iPad

"Love this keyboard!  I debated a long time about it due to cost but was considering upgrading my MacBook and ended up going with this option instead, so technically cheaper :)  I had the keyboard for the old iPad Pro and this is hands down a much better product and provides much closer to a laptop experience.  The keys are soft and quiet, but don‚Äôt have that odd fabric feel.  It‚Äôs heavy, sure, but the older keyboard drove me crazy because it wouldn‚Äôt sit flat on the table due to the weight of the iPad so it would move up and down as I typed.  This solves that problem, it‚Äôs nice and sturdy.  And the trackpad is the game changer!  It didn‚Äôt truly feel like a laptop on the old one because you‚Äôd have to break rhythm to switch between typing and tapping the screen.  This trackpad is small yet mighty, and uses all the familiar gestures I am used to with MacBook.  More customization options than I expected as well - you can adjust tracking speed, level of light on the keys, toggle tap to click on and off, etc.  It‚Äôs easy to pop the iPad on and off with the magnet attachment, and the folding experience is very laptop like.<br /><br />Out of curiosity, I weighed it with my iPad Pro inside and it clocked in at just over 2.3 pounds - so despite users claiming it‚Äôs heavy, it‚Äôs still lighter overall than the MacBook Air I was considering by a bit, and much lighter than my old 2015 MacBook Pro that clocks in at a pound heavier.  I‚Äôm very happy with my choice, despite the premium price point!",0.96,299.0,0.12420634920634924,0.5088735974987483,iPad

"I am a Product Designer. Let‚Äôs just get that out in front. I make very carefully considered purchases, and this folio keyboard was one of them. I had my doubts, as should you: The cheesy vinyl ‚Äúskin‚Äù of this product had me worried about longevity. The cost! Don‚Äôt even mention the cost. Crazy. It is NOT a complex product. So why, you may ask, did I buy it? My faith and enjoyment of Apple product design. Always a leader in the industry, they have not disappointed. This keyboard worked well for about three years. Now, it has slowly become a source of constant frustration. Im using it now, and three times already i have had to disconnect it, and reconnect it several times each to keep typing. It even started deleting my writing all by itself! Ironic, no? I had to yank it off of my iPad Pro II to stop it, then re-type my missing text. That is the worst of it, but not the whole of my complaints. The skin is some kind of urethane/vinyl hybrid material and it has been heat-welded at the edges leaving a very cheap-feeling edge. That edge is now splitting in several places. The hinge is failing too, and the surface is separating from the body in the corners. It is also slightly sticky now, reacting to some kind of environmental chemistry. My hand lotion? Sunscreen? Food oils? Who knows. All unforgivable in terms of good design. Im now constantly getting the message that ‚ÄúAccessory Not Supported by this device‚Äù! but‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs APPLE!!! Ugh. (Happened twice already here)  It also does NOT protect your precious device. NO corner protection at all, some surface protection but only magnetically attached, so it will slip out of the case given any moderate forces. Your crazy-expensive Apple Pencil 2? Forget it. It will fall off given the slightest forces because the magnets in it are the only thing holding it on. NOT a good travel option at all! SO many things about it are SO poorly executed. I‚Äôm replacing it with a ‚Äú. typecase iPad Pro 11 Magic-Style Keyboard Case  ‚Äú. Much better protection, more reasonable cost, backlit keys, a switchable trackpad, iOS function keys, better screen angle design, pencil retainer, MUICH better materials. There are several like it out there. Logitech makes a good one too. The even MORE expensive Apple keyboard case is far bulkier, heavier and not so flexible.

"I have never in my life written a review. However, to maybe spare someone my mistake, I‚Äôm sharing. Early in July the 2nd generation Apple Pencil went on sale and knowing my 3 kids were getting new iPads at school this year and were expected to have an Apple Pencil or stylus, I eagerly bought three of them, happy to save quite a bit of money. Fast forward to today when we picked up their iPads, which are iPad 10s, only to find out the newest Apple Pencil doesn‚Äôt work on the newest iPad. Of course it doesn‚Äôt. Why would Apple do that???

"This keyboard has a nice feel ‚Äî the keys are punchy and responsive. But there are some design flaws that render it quite hard to use.<br /><br />1) The near edges have a poorly-trimmed plastic ridge that irritates your palms if you type with your hands resting on the typing surface. (Sure, you‚Äôre supposed to lift your hands above the table, but remember, this is an iPad, and the ‚Äútable‚Äù is often your lap or a pillow.) So if you‚Äôre not careful, you practically get blisters, especially on the left palm just below the pinky.<br /><br />2) There is a silly emoji button in the lower left. I rarely want to use an emoji, and if I do, it‚Äôll just be in the Messages app ‚Äî where there is a convenient on-screen emoji button. The predictive text row also has an emoji icon. The hardware button seems designed only to interrupt my workflow ‚Äî I‚Äôll accidentally hit it with my palm (the one rubbed raw by Apple‚Äôs plastic case) as I reach for T or 5. And it took away from the width of the modifier keys, so control, option, and command are tiny.

"When I purchased my 3rd generation 12.9‚Äù iPad Pro on December 12th, 2018, Apple only offered this smart folio. The leather version is still missing. Now, not even 2 years later, after moderate to light use by adults only, this case is falling apart.<br /><br />The polyurethane first began wrinkling, within months of purchase, wherever my fingers put pressure on the exterior. So, almost immediately, the folio began to look bad. Look cheap. Then the edge of the lid started to peel away and delaminate. Therefore, only 22 months after purchase and I‚Äôm looking for a new case. Unacceptable! I‚Äôve had an iPad Air 2 since 2014, with an Apple Leather Folio, and it still looks practically brand new 6 years later. For this case to only last 22 months is a testament to the fact that Apple has gotten so greedy, it is now affecting their build quality.<br /><br />I would not buy this case again.

However I had a realization that I should be using my iPad more considering just how much they can do. It did everything my janky laptop did, but better and faster all it was missing was a keyboard.

"Okay, lets get the price out of the way. Yes it‚Äôs expensive. Yes you could buy another base iPad for not much more than the cost of the keyboard. But this accessory completely transforms the way you interact and function with your iPad.<br /><br />Ever since picking up the magic keyboard I have been using my iPad Air as my mobile daily driver for work/school and rarely feel the need to pull my laptop out anymore. The build quality is excellent, keyboard is satisfying to type on, and trackpad support in iOS is excellent. The balance of the keyboard is such that you never feel at risk of the iPad tipping when docked and the whole system just functions so intuitively. Docking and undocking is a breeze thanks to the magnets and smart connector on the back of the iPad, keyboard backlight adjusts automatically based on the iPad brightness settings, usb power pass-through makes the system easy to charge and have an extra USB port for connections, etc.<br /><br />This basically makes the iPad into your one-stop shop for all your mobile needs.

"Was a bit skeptical at first, but I have been blown away by this purchase! I was expecting the iPad to come with a couple nicks or a few minor scratches, since it's ""renewed"", but when I opened the box I was treated with a PRISTINE iPad Pro. I mean completely brand new looking. Not a single ding, scratch, dent, or any other flaws. I also did a diagnostic test on the battery to see its health and if it has kept its full capacity. Again, I was expecting the battery capacity to be maybe 85-90% at max, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was at 99.5%! (This is not battery life, but the actual capacity of the battery relative to when it was brand new). I ordered on a Sunday night and the package arrived two days earlier than expected, on a Wednesday; very impressive! In terms of the packaging, the iPad was protected decently well, although I do think it wouldn't hurt just to add a bit more padding. It didn't come in the original Apple box nor did it come with the original Apple USB-C charger, which wasn't an issue for me since I already have a ton lying around. If you are going to purchase a renewed iPad from Amazon, make sure to select BuySPRY as the seller - they are incredible and I am very very happy with my purchase.

"All of my reviews on Amazon are usually very enthusiastic for the product I'm writing it for, but the Apple magsafe adapter is horrible-- not only the old model but the new model (which may be worse). I am now on my THIRD new model in a matter of probably 7 months, and went through FOUR old models that became unwired at the actual magsafe part (oh yeah, and would spark and smoke). I do not abuse the wiring and my laptop stays mostly on my desk, except for the few times it moves to my bed or the couch; I rarely take it out of the home. The new one is supposed to be flush with the laptop to theoretically cause less bending, but instead it spins around and around until the wiring shorts out. Of course each time I noticed it coiled I would fix it and try to straighten out the wiring, but after a few months of this, the wiring just completely quits conducting electricity.<br /><br />It's absolutely ridiculous that I have to spend close to a $100 dollars every couple of months! I really could NOT care less how ""thin"" and ""stylish"" it is-- I want it to work AND for a respectable amount of time. This time I used duct tape around the magsafe part up to a few inches to prevent the wire bending. Hopefully this helps and actually makes this POS have a life span of more than three months.<br /><br />In summary, I love Apple, I have all their products, including the iPad, but their wiring (including the usb connections) really need new engineering.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Have proceeded to go through 3 more of these adapters. Two of them broke off at the magnet part, so there was a magnet stuck in my MacBook Air. Such crap!",0.9400000000000001,79.0,0.0356198347107438,0.4907452585593633,iPad
Bought this for my 2018 iPad Pro and it brought so much ease of use to video and photo editing. I had to watch a tips and tricks YouTube to discover the switch for tap to click feature. Brings Magic Trackpad functionality too with gestures. Holding the CMD key for a few seconds will bring up shortcuts that can be used depending what app you are in. Adds a bit of weight to the ipad and now doesn‚Äôt fit into my small sling bag as it used to with the folio case by Ô£ø (mainly because the hinge makes it a bit wider). Overall i feel like i own a new laptop now. I purchased this while it was on sale for $199! One drawback is the limited ability to fold the keyboard behind the ipad to just use the touchscreen on your lap. I spoze you can just remove the case all together. Also i advise to be careful holding in your flat palm. It is very top heavy and i almost dropped it!,0.96,299.0,0.08691829004329002,0.49022956791721867,iPad

"First off, the stylus is great for taking notes, marking up documents, and just doodling. Very low latency, the matte finish is a much needed upgrade over the glossy material used in the last generation, and it's flat edge makes it easier to just leave on the table. The magnets and wireless charging are definite upgrades.<br /><br />Now, let's get into why I had to buy the new version. I recently got one of the new iPad Pros to replace an older iPad and I still had the first generation Apple Pencil. Me being naive, I thought the old one would work fine with the brand new iPad. Wrong. Even if you have a lightning to USB-C cable and the lightning-lightning adapter, you still can't pair the old one to the new iPad. This is very annoying, but I can't say that I'm surprised.

"I looked at lots of reviews for renewed Ipads and am happy I went with this one. I upgraded from my 3 year old 6th gen ipad 9.7 in. I wanted an ipad with faceID (like my phone) and a bigger screen but wasn't looking to spend more than $600. This one arrived via prime shipping, in a plain box with a third party usbc charger. I was pleasantly surprised that this ipad pro already had a previously-applied screen protector on it with no signs of damage. The body of the ipad is also flawless. I hooked up to my itunes and popped in my Verizon SIM card and it worked right away with no problems.

This review would be 5 stars, however, I'm writing a 3-star review today, 5 months after my purchase because I came across an issue with the charger and lightning cable. Turns out I wasn't given an Apple licensed charger/cable. I had to bring my iPad into an Apple store the other day to have them check it out and figure out why my iPad wasn't charging with what it came with. The tech person said the charging block was a really good fake - she could tell because the font color was slightly different and it didn't even say it was made by Apple - it just said it was made in California. She also could tell that the lightning cable wasn't made by Apple because parts of it were &#34;more shiny&#34;. Luckily I have a spare cable to use my iPad again but it would've cost $50 for a brand new charger! ($30 for the 12W charging block and $20 for the lightning cable) - that's outrageous, Apple!<br /><br />For being a certified refurbished product, I am taken back by having a fake charger.

"As far as refurbished devices go this listing is fine, I got exactly what I ordered and no more (literally the iPad and aftermarket charger in an excessively large box).<br /><br />In terms of the iPad itself, I'm honestly underwhelmed and disappointed with Apple. I'm not really an Apple lover and very much love my Android phone, but if you want a good quality tablet there's not many Android options, and all of those are significantly more expensive than this iPad.<br /><br />Hardware wise the iPad feels great and the screen looks nice, but I had problems with the touch responsiveness and iOS did not do a good job visually communicating the boundaries of the touch areas and apparently tapping on a back button doesn't work, but tapping just to the right does. Maybe my unit is defective, but honestly it was annoying to use.<br /><br />Then there's the software. I don't get a long with iPadOS. I'm sure a lot of that comes from my Android background, but there's just so many little annoying things like not being able to add empty space between icons on home screens, confusing settings (turns out disabling the incredibly annoying password prompt to install FREE apps is hidden in your apple id and not under the app store or device passcode settings, and is also buggy and has to be toggled for it to be recognized, and there's no option for a basic thing like screen dim timeout so the screen is always simming way faster than I like). I've heard there's some amazing iPad only apps and I'm sure that's true, but honestly I just want a tablet to browse the web (which Android does better since it supports ad blocking browser extensions), watch video (iPad hardware is nice with the screen and speakers, but then there's no YouTube Vanced or headphone jack) and play an occasional game (the handful of not terrible mobile games I actually play are on both platforms and the Apple hardware is nice but Apple store apps are generally more expensive and no option to sideload systemwide adblockers like Blokada, and Android also supports emulators).<br /><br />If you're used to Apple you know what you're getting into and will probably love the hardware and small form factor, but for someone coming over from Android be mindful that iPadOS is still very limiting in a lot of frustrating ways and not as bug free as Apple would like everyone to believe.<br /><br />I ended up selling it to a family member who is fine with the limitations, but otherwise would have returned it.",0.9,549.95,0.15498511904761902,0.4695730449216676,iPad
"I got iPad Pro and Apple Pencil 2 to teach remote classes. Overall it actually works unlike other pens on other touchscreens I tried, but there are some things that could be improved.<br /><br />The battery life is too short. After two classes in a row (2.5 hours) it just stopped.<br /><br />After few months the pencil would not pair any more and stopped. Apple did replace it under AppleCare it but not without inquisition about damage first and wanted credit card in case of damage to ship replacement. The shipping took too long so I bought a spare on Amazon, I figured if one died it may happen again and I cannot afford that.  Then the return instructions wanted the bad one pretty quick or else they would charge the card. Not good. They confirmed that the return was received but not if it was accepted without a charge. Months later the repair status is still that a technician will look at it soon.<br /><br />The pencil keeps falling off the iPad and getting lost. This is really bad. There should be a way to locate it - buzz or ring or at least some indicator on the iPad that the pencil is nearby. Regardless if it is paired or not, I have two, and only one can be paired at a time.<br /><br />Mostly it draws fine but occasionally the line does get interrupted and or it makes extra long straight lines or changes the tool when when I touch it by hand (palm rejection not working quite right).

"My biggest complaint and the reason I will be returning the Magic Keyboard for the iPad Pro: it nearly nullifies the functionality of the iPad Pro as a tablet.  Basically, the Magic Keyboard turns your iPad into a MacBook with a touch screen.  It also renders the Apple Pencil almost pointless.  Apple really should have engineered a way to have the keyboard and trackpad fold behind the tablet.  Though, I will admit, the feel of the keyboard is outstanding, but it is missing function keys that I have grown to appreciate.  Logitech and other brands typically include a few tablet specific buttons on their keyboards - home button, volume, search, camera, etc..  Quality is top notch, functionality is lacking.

"I bought an iPad Pro 12.9&#34; as an experimental laptop replacement, and buying this made all the difference. Some people reported not liking the feel; I actually really enjoy it. It's very quiet and the completely covered keys make for easy cleaning. It holds the iPad at only one angle in typing position, and although it's not exactly the angle I'd use for a MacBook screen, I haven't had any serious issues with it, either.<br /><br />If it's a drain on iPad battery power, it isn't significant enough to notice. (And, compared to external keyboards that need their own power sources, the fact this runs off iPad power - and very little of it - is worth the price difference alone. Between the iPad, my iPhone 7+, and an Apple Pencil, not to mention a Garmin Fenix 3 GPS running watch, I have enough chargers to worry about without having to worry about a keyboard charger, too.<br /><br />And yes, there's no backlight, but I don't look at my fingers when I type, and if I DID need to look, the iPad ambient light usually provides enough visibility for those times when I'm typing in the dark. Which aren't many. I still say not having to charge the thing outweighs a lack of backlighting. If you really need a lit-up keyboard, it doesn't get any brighter than the one on the screen. Just saying. :)<br /><br />The ONLY thing I don't like about this (and all Apple SmartCovers) is that the microfiber surface that comes in contact with your screen when the cover is completely closed is the same surface that makes contact with the desk, the kitchen counter, or whatever surface you happen to put it on. So you wind up potentially transferring a lot of crumbs, dog fur, dust, etc. from surfaces to your screen.

"So the product works great, however I‚Äôve already had to buy two of these because both of mine have died on me after only a few months of use.

I use my IPad Pro for artwork, so once that goes these are useless for anything, because you can only achieve hairline strokes after that.<br /><br />Apple won‚Äôt replace them nor repair them, so I was forced to buy a new one. I looked it up online and everyone said they last a while so I though okay maybe I just got a bad one.<br /><br />Well bought a new one, this one in its defense, lasted for almost 5 months, but then died too. These aren‚Äôt cheap, and it‚Äôs becoming really frustrating when you can‚Äôt find any answers and there‚Äôs no help whatsoever from the company themselves outside of just have to replace the pencil.<br /><br />I don‚Äôt know, this is almost $500 already just spent on replacing these pencils. I‚Äôm going to buy this last one and if it dies on me as well, then I‚Äôm going to look into other styluses. I can‚Äôt afford to be buying these things every few months.<br /><br />I guess anyone looking to buy these, just be aware that you may be in for a constant money pit or perhaps I‚Äôm just having horrible luck.

"Ugh. I'm just not a fan of Apple and their crazy os. I got this as a mobile device for company facetime calls. The one good thing I have to say is that it's a lot thinner and lighter than I was expecting. And if you like all the undocumented swiping, multi-finger swiping, and pinching, then you'll probably like this tablet. But the interface is just hard to work with. I have to plug it in every day (even if I only use it for a couple calls). There's only a power button and volume buttons, so everything else is some sort of swipe with an undocumented number of fingers on an undocumented side of the screen. It seems to use an incredible amount of bandwidth when I'm not using it for anything. And it really, really, REALLY wants you to set up face ID. Even if it sits in a locked office, with no personal data on it. There's that badge letting you know you haven't finished setting it up. Even though you use it every day.",0.8800000000000001,529.0,0.11354166666666665,0.44591429617919764,iPad

"This was the worst product experience of my life. I just bought a 4th Gen iPad Pro, and I got this to go with it. Firat step on the troubleshooting list checked off, boys. They will work together. My Pencil would pair, I could even see it in the General sention of the Settings app. No response on my screen. None.<br /><br />I can doodle with my fingertip, so I know the screen on my iPad's fine. I run through the Whole List of 8 Steps on the appletoolbox website. Nothing works. I call Apple Support.<br /><br />Since I had done all the troubleshooting steps myself (including the forethought to order replacement tips to try), dude basically said I could drive it in or get a replacement after a $16 service fee for my broken brand new item? It is not even 24 hrs in my possession, and they want another $20 to fix what they sold to me broken???<br /><br />No, thanks.",0.9400000000000001,89.0,-0.05670995670995669,0.4431183211077213,iPad

"I keep trying to post a video to show the problem but Amazon won‚Äôt let me. iPad was dead upon arrival so I charged it for about an hour before using it.

"My fault, didn't research carefully enough and Apple makes it hard to find info - this does not work from an iPad.  You have to have an iPhone to use this device.  My husband has one, so I'm using his with it, but it's frustrating.  Also, this thing is heavy, really heavy!  I got the smaller face because I have small wrists, and this barely fits on the flat of my wrist as it is.  And the bulge in the back where it connects to the skin for sensing is somewhat uncomfortable but I think I will get used to it.  I don't want a gazillion apps on it and apparently I cannot delete some of them that I will never use (that's not awesome Apple, thanks!)  I am not a huge fan of Apple's UIs generally and this watch fits right in there.  Haven't figured out yet how to use the ECG feature, but that's one of the reasons I got it, so I will have to spend some quality time reading the manual (on my husband's iPhone, again, awesome Apple, so nice they make it so hard to download the manual onto a PC trying to force us to assimilate).

"I bought this new Macbook Pro 15&quot; with Touch Bar from Apple.com. I have been using it for a few days and I have only one word to say &quot;AMAZING&quot;. I am an avid Apple user and have a few Apple devices like iPad Pro 9.7&quot;, iPhone 4s, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s plus, iPhone 7 plus, iPhone SE, and now this to provide some context.<br /><br />Overview: This particular model which I have (Maxed-out except SSD), 16GB RAM, 2.9GHz quad-core Intel Core i7, Radeon Pro 460 with 4GB, 256GB SSD) is definitely a Pro machine. I would highly recommend this machine to people looking for an excellent replacement for their previous pro generation models with great screen.<br /><br />Design: This machine is typical Apple it is well designed with a thin and light form factor. It is a truly gorgeous looking machine. It is 3.3kgs according to the box and much less weight for a pro i7 and dedicated GPU machine like this. The chassis is very compact for the size of the machine overall.<br /><br />Display: I admit I am a screen noob and don't know much about the screen machanics and people say it's the same resolution like previous models  but this screen is quite gorgeous the color is great and more brighter and definitely welcome if you have iPad Pro 9.7 and iPhone 7 plus which also have this color gamut. The colors are rich. This thing is eye piercing bright. Much brighter then any other laptop I have ever used. Overall it is great having the extra real-estate of the larger screen when compared to the 13‚Äù Macbook.<br /><br />Keyboard: I love the new keyboard and the loud clicky sound it produces. I know this is a user specific thing and so try it out but give it a chance because in my experience it took me a few days to get used to. This is similar in that it has much less travel then the older MBP. The larger keys are also easier to make less mistakes on. There is something satisfying about the sound though.<br /><br />Touch Pad: Great but it's HUGE. I wish they would have made Apple pencil compatibility that would have been quite awesome. I think the touch bar  will be quite useful in the long run as more applications will be made in the coming months maybe I‚Äôll be proved wrong over time but the placement seems good once you use it.<br /><br />Speed: This machine is fast if you are looking at it compared to an Air or a 12‚Äù machine. The SSD screams and the package overall is excellent for the right consumer.<br /><br />Price: So the elephant in the room is price. This is about $500 north of obnoxious pricing. I think it is a fine machine and I love it personally but I had a feel of being gouged a bit by Apple at $3,000. When compared to the previous pro well that is a bit odd because that machine is really old when you look at it the screen alone is ancient and the touch bar so basically we are paying this much for the touchbar and you can get the same hardware in other brands but again Apple is Apple you can't compare Apple with any other brand in terms of creativity and customer service<br /><br />I do recommend this machine to the right consumer. Namely to a previous MacBook Pro user or anyone who was looking to buy a Dell XPS or any other premium machine from any other brand, a person looking for a great screen, battery life, faster SSD and something new and this will last 3-5 years, Go for this one you will not be disappointed at all.<br /><br />The only small gripe I have is that it doesn‚Äôt come in the range of colors like rose gold or even new colors to attract more customers. It is a small minor thing but oh well don't forget the extra dongles we need for everything we get Four Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports and can't even connect our iPhone 7 plus with this new machine but again people will get used to it as we got with the headphone jack not being there on the iPhone 7 and USB-C is the future that's why Apple is doing this.<br /><br />ATLEAST WE HAVE THE HEADPHONE JACK ON THIS MACHINE .! :P (y)<br /><br />Good Luck buying this machine and look at the pictures below to see how it looks :)",0.82,1020.03,0.18808329601433052,0.39339447523038246,iPad

The device was advertised as ""Renewed"" but upon arrival, it was obvious that it had been heavily abused and poorly maintained.

To make matters worse, the battery life could have been better and it would frequently shut down randomly.<br /><br />I was highly disappointed with this purchase as I was expecting a high-quality device given the price I paid. Instead, I received a device that was in very bad condition and barely usable.

"These headphones are heavy and yet super comfortable. They don't squeeze your head, the way some headphones do. They just rest softly on your head and after awhile you forget that they are there. These headphones are high end and look incredibly sharp, compared to the bulky look of the Bose headphones or the weird square headband of the Sennheiser headphones I used to have.<br /><br />The sound is really good. Music on my iPod sounds good and podcasts are clear. I also used these with my flat screen. The built-in speakers on the flat screens aren't the best. When I used these headphones, the improvement in sound clarity was amazing. I just need to get a longer cord so I can use them for late night TV watching.<br /><br />These headphones are large and yet they fold up into a nice hard case. They also come with two cords and one has a built-in microphone. With the microphone cord these could be used for communicating with phones or iPads, and then music and movies would be in high quality stereo sound.<br /><br />These headphones are noise cancelling, and come with two different headphone jack attachments so they can be used on planes. These are actually the perfect flying headphones, they have all of the jacks, and noise cancelling, and they look good, and are comfortable to wear.<br /><br />Sometimes I wear them with just the noise cancelling on to block outside noise. A couple other interesting things about these headphones is that they require two AAA batteries and the battery compartment has a magnetic cover on one side that easily pops on and off. They also come in a really nice box, so these could be an impressive gift. Overall the sound is good and the design is excellent.",0.78,,0.30581349206349207,,iPad

"When I went to pick up my iPad the opening week this past year, I knew, like most of my other products I bought from Apple (iPhone, iPod Touch, MacBook etc..) that I am going to want to get a case.<br /><br />And of course, being a new product, a lot of companies weren't out on the market with their personal take on a case, so Apple had their own brand made, which is the case in question.<br /><br />I liked it at first, it gave it a professional look, but similar to what other people stated, it gave a weird feel to the iPad. You had to hold a certain way to interact with the iPad and showing other people. It only tilts so much, that you're better off sitting upright using the tilt function, because laying down, or any other position, it was pointless.<br /><br />Then, that professional look I was talking about? That all went out the window, because after a few weeks of house, the way the material is on the case itself, it picked up finger prints, dust, and all other kinds of stuff. And it's not very easy to clean off either.<br /><br />Pretty much in short, for us early adopters, this was our only option for a while, but now, with Xmas under way, and the iPad having a few months under it's belt, you're better off getting something else. There's tons of nice portfolio's, packs, slip cases, skins etc for it, that you'll be alright finding a good fit for you",0.86,,0.11781543109668109,,iPad

"For several years I used various brands of PDAs.  The Apple IPod Touch has perfected this device. It is excellent for music, but it has become a valuable tool for keeping up with things and finding out where things are. It takes good snap shots and is a library in your pocket. I also have an iPad. But the portability of the iPod touch lets you have your device in tow when you don't have a lot of room to carry stuff.  If you want an iPhone and are waiting for a contract to expire...this is a great tool. I carry it around with a small portable hot spot. My android phone exhausts it's battery in a very short time if used for anything other than calling.

"The single star is my response to how this purchase made me feel.<br />Cons:<br />What‚Äôs in the box? Just the iPad, power adapter and a cord that‚Äôs incompatible with everything I own and every available plug in various airplanes, buses, coffee shops and my home. Apple has yet again forced our hand in changing a plug because they think it‚Äôs best. In turn I had to purchase separately a USBc to USB and a USBc to Lightening. An extra cost and wait time of adapters that would have cost Apple nothing to include. I also had to purchase a cover and opted for a third-party keyboard version, not Apple‚Äôs $180 one. Again, the very least that could have included was a simple covering case as this model seems so fragile. To address the ‚ÄúPro‚Äù of this, nothing about the device is Pro, additional plug types, card reader, something, but this uses the same iOS as any of the non-pro models, so not getting it?  I have the previous 1st edition of the iPad, that when I first purchased it, I took it everywhere with me until the romance was over and iPhone started to have just as much options. The Apple Pencil, which also does not come with this, and most certainly should have, was an extra $130 purchase. As opposed to the ads where they show it sticking magnetically to the sides, locked on to charge and be available to you, does not. There‚Äôs a sweet spot you have to align the pencil with and falls off with the slightest bump or swift movement, so I‚Äôm sure I will be loosing that anytime now. So, sounds like I should just return this and go for the similar in function and far cheaper cost of a Samsung or the like, right?<br />Pros: It‚Äôs super fast. It glides and zooms quicker than anything else I own.  Using the pencil feels the most natural to any other tablet set up I‚Äôve tried. Once the new cord arrives, so I can actually transfer all my music, photos, and books, I know it will be my new best buddy.<br /><br />I purchased this because I an upgrade option came up on my iPhone. I have the 7s Max, which works completely fine and I use less and less for anything more than texts and emails. But for less than the price of the newest iPhone, I could get this iPad ‚Äúpro‚Äù, which I could actually get a ton more use out of. Let‚Äôs see. But as far as Apple as a company, they make me feel like an adopted sibling that has to work a little harder for anything the rest of the family is just given. It always feels like excess without any actual extras.",0.96,,0.16735855230041274,,iPad

"I previously owned a Late 2011 13&#34; MacBook Pro and an 11&#34; MacBook Air Early 2016. The Macbook Pro was my main machine and the MacBook Air was something that I got at a great price. I thought that I would favor the MacBook Pro, but as I used the MacBook Air I began to appreciate the design philosophy of it more and more. The MacBook Pro seemed to be a cement brick next to the Air, and so I began to favor the Air because I find myself moving around with my laptops more and more. Portability has become very important to me. I loved the Air, and surprisingly enough I even liked the smaller form factor. It was easy to move, about the same size as my iPad Air 2 with a ClamCase, and it was a full computer.<br /><br />I fantasized about getting the 13&#34; Air only because of the inferior display on the 11&#34;. I had to get a custom color profile to be able to use it properly. Still, after that it became my go to device as it was small and fast. In the end, I sold it because it only came with 128GB of storage, which is paltry considering the 13&#34; MacBook Pro had 750GB of space and I was almost full on that.<br /><br />When the MacBook originally came out I was one of the detractors of it. That was because the idea behind it was a bit harder to ascertain right away. My thoughts, especially considering the specs, were that the MacBook Air was much better of a value. The new MacBook is a bit of a niche device. It won't be apparent why you may want to try it right away. I wanted to get a 15&#34; MacBook Pro with a Retina display, but the price of the one that I wanted was a bit high, given the fact that that computer is way more machine than I need to have for the price.<br /><br />While I wanted a new computer the MacBook Pro I had was still fine; I mainly wanted newer features like the Bluetooth 4.0, the ability to do handoff with apps, the retina display, and so forth. When I purchased this MacBook, it was the new updated model (second version). I would not have wanted the first one, but the upgrades made to the 2016 version made it far more attractive. It comes with 512GB of flash storage, which is not as much as the 1TB I wanted but far less expensive. Also, it is more of a standard size. I became a fan of flash storage when I had the MacBook Air, and I don't want to use any computer that does not have Flash storage now!<br /><br />This MacBook is the gold version, which I got to match my gold iPhone 6 Plus and my gold iPad Air 2. Every version looks good, and the newest color is the rose gold one. I also got the version with the m5 dual core processor for more power. The MacBook comes with 8GB of memory standard, and that is more than enough with the flash storage. One negative with this laptop and pretty much all of Apple's current and future laptops is that they are moving towards soldering the RAM and the storage to the logic board so that they are no longer user-upgradeable. That means that you must buy what you want as far as those things go as you cannot upgrade them later.<br /><br />The MacBook has a 12&#34; Retina Display, which is gorgeous. The neat thing is that the MacBook and the 11&#34; MacBook Air have the same size chassis. The MacBook is able to get a 12&#34; display onto the same chassis as the 11&#34; by reducing the size of the bezel. I like the size of the 11' MacBook Air so that is a plus for me. In terms of size, the 12&#34; MacBook puts the Air to shame. I did not think any computer could be lighter than the Air, but boy was I wrong. The Air is like a brick compared to the size of the MacBook. I can easily lift it and carry it with one hand only. It is feather light but still very sturdy.<br /><br />The keyboard uses the new butterfly mechanism which does fatigue your fingers when you first start using it, but as you get used to the way it works it becomes very easy to use. The main thing is that the keys require minimal effort to push, so you need to learn to press them very lightly. The keys are full-sized and backlit. The speakers on the new MacBook are surprisingly good. I am always nervous when I see a speaker grille below the monitor as most are not good, but the speakers are clear and loud.<br /><br />The other controversy about the MacBook is the single USB-C port. Yes, they could have tried to put another on, but given the way they had to engineer the laptop to get it to be so small and light, concessions had to be made somewhere and the port was it. The USB-C port is the only port to connect any peripherals (other than a 3.5 mm headphone jack), so you have to use it to charge the laptop as well as to connect anything like a USB cable or anything like that. You can easily get an adapter that allows you to connect more than one thing at a time, but they are somewhat pricey. As the USB-C technology (which is good and I like it very much) becomes more common, the cost should go down. At first I was very annoyed by this but as time went on, I have adjusted to the single port. I find that now I am able to understand that this laptop is more for those who want maximum portability, and for those who want a device to use mainly with wireless/bluetooth accessories and cloud services.<br /><br />The force touch trackpad seems a bit gimmicky to me. I almost never use the deep press option, but I can see how it would be useful. Perhaps there will be more configuration options that make it more useful, but for now I am using the trackpad as I always have. The MacBook does have a pretty low resolution camera. I don't film videos on my MacBook or use it for anything other than basic Facetime and such, so that does not bother me. There are some people who are heartbroken that the camera is not full HD, but the camera is not heavy duty due to the way the MacBook is designed. To make it the thinnest and lightest, that was one concession that had to be made.<br /><br />There are many concerns about the performance of the laptop. The first version had a few performance issues that made it a hard recommendation, but the 2016 upgrade has minimized those issues. I have run Parallels (2 Windows VMs) at the same time I was streaming YouTube videos and I was able to jump between them with little issues. I have had it freeze on me twice, and there have been some hangs, but nothing that has not happened to me on either the MacBook Pro or Air. I think that there has been a lot of misinformation about what this laptop can handle. Make no mistake, this is not a workstation. Yes, you can use some powerful programs on it, but it is not meant to be a heavy duty machine. The average user will have no problems with it in terms of performance. I have heard of people using auto CAD software on it without any issue. I also ran Final Cut and Logic Pro on it, and while it does take a bit of time to process and render with those programs it is more than capable of running them without a catastrophe. The processor was chosen because the MacBook is a fanless laptop, so they had to pick a processor that would not overheat without active cooling. It means that the processor is less powerful, but it still works.<br /><br />In short, the design philosophy behind the MacBook is that it is mean to be the most powerful and lightest ultrabook that it can be. It had to balance power, performance, price, storage, and features to get there, and so the result is a machine that does not seem to follow the obvious design options as any other laptop available. If you can open your mind, however, this laptop can be exactly what you need. More and more people have began loving it, and even I myself have warmed up to it. I used to wonder if I should go back to my MacBook Pro, but now I am more than satisfied with this one. I had the chance to get a MacBook Pro 15&#34; and decided against it as now that I am familiar with this laptop, given the price, features, and how I use it, the MacBook Pro would have been unnecessary. Many tech reviewers now state this is their daily driver for anything that is not hardware intensive, and I am right with them. I love the MacBook and I am glad that I gave it a try. If you can allow yourself to give it a try I would recommend it because you may find that it is a better option for you than you think.",0.86,,0.17918086543086542,,iPad

"I didn't buy this product from Amazon but i am writing this review let my fellow buyers know the facts about this device.<br /><br />When Beats Launched this product, it looks so promising and impressed me to pre register myself to buy when they are available.<br />First didn't get any email notification when the product was available. I came to know from my friend after he started using it. This is big time recklessness from Beats about it's potential customers.<br /><br />I ordered this product on Beats website to save the taxes, i got my product little late but no complaints about the delivery process, weekend came in between.<br /><br />I received the product and the packaging is OK OK. I opened it and i had to charge it fully before i started pairing it with my iPhone 5S.<br /><br />The full charging was quick and within couple of hrs i can able to start it, pair it and started listening to the music. everything is going well, i am very happy and started taking them with me for work outs. it was working fine. battery life also seems good.<br /><br />After 2 -3 days of using this product and started putting together my experience to write my review on this product, that's where the problem has started.<br /><br />Issues:<br />1) It doesn't sync well with Apple products (I was using iPhone 5S and iPad 3). When you play the music it takes little time to start on the headset. also when i accept the call with headset's accept button there is gap in connecting with phone and hearing the outside voice. This is completely a surprise me. when i used it with android phone, it seems working fine but i didn't spend much time with that device (samsung).<br /><br />2) The sound quality for music is not so great. I the max sound is not so impressive and noise cancellation is also not perfect.<br /><br />I spoke to my other friend and explained about my observations, and replied me that i have already complained about it to Beats and they said they cant do anything except refund. that guy was already returned the product.<br /><br />Meanwhile Beats merged with Apple and moved their sales to iTunes. I had to contact to Apple. I contacted them and i got positive response from them as usual. they called me 3-4 times and asked several repeated questions and confirmed that they know the problem and they don't have any solution. they also offered me refund option.<br /><br />At the end i had to give up (return) this product.<br /><br />Conclusion: They made a great product but forgot to integrate it well. And this price tag $200 it is not worth facing those problems. I am hoping they (Apple) will fix these issues in their iOS 8. until then i recommend you to wait. this is the worst experience i have ever faced with Apple so far.",0.82,,0.22860422405876954,,iPad
"Time will tell whether these will fall apart like other people have described in other reviews. That said, I wanted to provide my insight into these as a product with an MSRP of about $200 and a &#34;street price&#34; of $100-$130.<br /><br />Let's start with the packaging. These are packaged very nicely, meant to showcase the item in the box itself. The box opens by pulling a thin strip of plastic at the bottom, like you would on an overnight shipping envelope. The window in the front opens up, and you can pull the headphones out. One of the rubber detachable earbuds came off in removing the earphones from the (what appeared to be recycled) cardboard. I had to rip apart the cardboard on the charge cable and tip case in order to extract them.<br /><br />Next, the feel in your hands. Man, these feel cheap to me. The cord, which has much in common with the appearance of fettuccine pasta, feels a bit flimsy. The plastic body of the earphones is very lightweight. The rubber ear hook is a bit flexible, but does *not* rotate or adjust otherwise.<br /><br />How about operation? Putting these on is pretty easy compared to some other hook-type earphones I've used. I still don't like that the ear hooks don't rotate at all, but that fact may actually be the reason they're easy to put on and take off. The power button is operated (when wearing them) by squeezing the left earphone with your index finger on top and your thumb on the bottom -- the button is on the top. You get a status chime when you turn them on, and they paired on the second (not first!) attempt to my iPhone 6S. Volume can be controlled directly from the iPhone or with the in-line buttons.<br /><br />Sound quality. Yes, the crux of many headphones. I've reviewed headphones on here from $30 to $300, and honestly, there isn't really a linear correlation between price and sound quality. These are not IEM earphones, so you do not get a full seal in your ears like you would with a Sure or Etymotic pair of IEM earphones. That said, the sound quality is better than I would have expected for something that does not seal. The bass is not nearly as impressive as I would have expected, but it does improve as you increase the volume to levels approaching what you could consider dangerous. If you press the earphones more toward your skull, you can definitely hear an improvement in bass, which is why I think these really don't perform so great. Sound clarity is quite good in the mid and high ends. Maybe a tad fatiguing as you get up high, but it's not offensive. I listened to live rock tracks, some Americana, bluegrass, and some modern rock. All sounded decently good. The sound quality is one notch better than my $35 Koss Portapro over-the-ear headphones, but not in the bass department.<br /><br />A brief note on comfort: After a couple hours, these have not hurt my ears like other earphones or headphones do. You may want to experiment with tip sizes to make sure you're getting optimal fit, since everyone's ears are different.The little cinch at the bottom works well to keep the cable from flying everywhere. I'll take these on a run and report back on whether they stayed in place.<br /><br />Let's move on to battery life. Out of the box, they registered a roughly 60% battery charge on my iPhone. After one hour, the indication dropped to 50%. Not bad considering an average listening volume of 40%.<br /><br />Finally, the carrying case, and a note to Beats: If you are going to provide accessories like a charging cable and additional tips, it would make sense for you to have an internal pouch for these accessories inside of your case. The case itself seems to be solidly-constructed, but lacks this pouch and is a bit clumsy to use with the way the zipper occasionally flips inside out.<br /><br />Overall, I do not think these should be priced a penny over $75. The only reason I own them is because of a recent Apple promotion that included a free pair with purchase of iPad or Mac. They were kind enough to retroactively apply this promotion to a purchase I made at the end of April, so I got a pretty neat set of headphones to review. Make no mistake, I would never pay the ~$130 current asking price for them, much less the $199.95 the box is labeled for.",0.82,,0.15931324110671938,,iPad

"I‚Äôve owned various Apple products over the years (going as far back as the iPod mini) and they would always include their signature headphones. Due to the design that Apple used (and many other manufacturers) I never liked their headphones because they wouldn‚Äôt stay in my ear. Sure maybe there‚Äôs some kind of magic that I wasn‚Äôt privy to but I always ended up relying on headphones with the rubber tips or something that would allow them to hang on via my ears. I guess some people don‚Äôt have that problem because I‚Äôve seen countless people wearing them with no issue. I always wanted to like the AirPods but since they still had the same design as previous generations of wired headphones I passed on those as well. Then upon researching the AirPods Pro I finally said to myself ‚ÄúOh yes, these are for me.‚Äù And then I finally got to experience the magic of AirPods. Sure there may be competitors who are a better value, better sound, or more features but these are just a treat. I love the transparency mode which I haven‚Äôt experienced since my old pair of Gear Icon Xs (sadly with the Icons the transparency mode only worked when you had both earbuds in and the feature stopped working after extensive use). I can maintain better situational awareness and still hear my music. In most cases they pair instantly to my phone and they can seamlessly transfer the sound over to my iPad or my Apple watch. Unlike most other earbuds from Apple these stay in my ears very well due to the rubber tips at the end. I can‚Äôt speak for how well they would be for working out or running as I don‚Äôt have that much faith in them (I‚Äôm not gonna gamble $200 to replace them if I lose one during a 3 mile run) which is why I wear my Beats Pro for running. For most activities they are amazing though. I can wear them for hours on end with no discomfort as well.<br />The only real downside I can think of after owning them for several months is they have very limited controls. I know they couldn‚Äôt add many buttons without increasing the size but I wish they had some way to allow you to control the volume or skip songs without having to use Siri or your phone. Even still I would definitely buy these again or a newer version because these are just amazing.",0.96,,0.21174948240165628,,iPad

I was holding off on buying this new I-Pod but then the price dropped on Amazon so I took the plunge.  I still am getting used to the item.  One thing that I'm not too keen on is the fact that you really can't use this product with more than one computer.

"For background, I am a recreational music producer and have typically used studio monitor setups ranging in price from $400 to over $1000. I have also owned a variety of Bose products including the QC15 noise cancelling headphones and multiple generations of SoundSport earbuds. I listen to at least 2 hrs of music a day. The listening experience on these earbuds vastly exceeds the Bose products I have owned and also rivals my professional grade KRK studio monitors. I will break down my review into a few categories:<br /><br />SIGNAL TO NOISE RATIO<br />The signal to noise ratio of these earbuds is truly exceptional. I have never heard any headphone or studio monitor with anywhere near as good of a signal to noise ratio. I am hearing details in music that didn't even come through clearly on my KRK studio monitors.<br /><br />NOISE CANCELLING<br />The noise cancelling is very good. Better than my Bose QC15s (headphones!) which were the industry standard years ago (granted, I haven't tried recent leaders like the Surface or Bose QC35s because I don't own them). For earbuds, I am impressed at how well they can block out sound.<br /><br />FIT and SEAL<br />I have average size ears so I chose the standard ""medium"" ear tips. My right earphone stays planted, but my left earphone slowly slips out over time. I believe this is due to the shape of my ear. They're not the most comfortable earbuds I have used because they have to press against your ear to make a good seal. After about an hour of listening I'm ready to take them out of my ears for a bit.<br /><br />FREQUENCY RESPONSE<br />The AirPods Pro have a pretty good frequency response. Mids are very clear and highs are sharp but are not piercing which is not easy to do. Bass is surprisingly a little heavy.. And I have a 1500W subwoofer in my car and a 8"" KRK sub connected to my studio monitors. So I'm a bit surprised at how much bass Apple decided to put in these. It's not at the point that it's distracting but I would say it's a little more low end than would be present in monitor grade equipment. For reference I listen to Hip Hop and Electronic music that tends to place a lot in the low end.<br /><br />TRANSPARENCY MODE<br />The transparency mode uses the microphones to amplify ambient sounds if you want to be more connected with the world around you such as when in an office where you might be approached. It definitely works. It sounds a bit artificial and not quite like real life but it surely helps hear what is happening around you. I would say this is not the setting to use for the best listening experience. Noise cancelling mode really helps engulf you in the music and is my preferred listening mode.<br /><br />CONVENIENCE:<br />Pairing to Apple devices is a breeze. I have a Mac, iPad, and iPhone and it is very quick to switch between them when I need. I have not tested connectivity on other devices, but it should work just fine as a normal bluetooth device for other equipment.<br /><br />OTHER<br />For some reason I thought these came with an app that would allow EQ modifications but they do not. Luckily the standard tuning is pretty balanced but like I said the low end is a bit inflated.<br /><br />Overall, these earbuds exceeded my expectation for the price point and are worth every penny. I am very happy with these!",0.96,,0.16207910486599011,,iPad

So I bought the iPad Pro 256 model and I am thrilled. The screen is beautiful, the design is so professional looking. I am using the beta of iPad OS so I can now use a mouse. It‚Äôs so fast, by far the fastest computer of any type I‚Äôve ever used. There seems to be an app for everything. I know it was a decent amount of money but when I think of what a high end laptop would cost, it doesn‚Äôt seem that expensive. And it‚Äôs lighter and perhaps faster. Bottom line is that I am so happy with this device and kudos to apple for listening and creating an OS that retains the apple feel but also integrates a laptop experience. Good job!",0.96,,0.2877094474153298,,iPad

"I purchased this iPad Pro brand new.. but my battery is somewhat defective. Sometimes, if my battery is left between 80-100% when turning it off, I will power it on the next day with the battery always reading 76%. I don‚Äôt know it always goes to that number. After I did a system reset, I‚Äôve noticed it become better. I think it has only happened once or twice over the last few weeks. And lately, it‚Äôs been better. Some days I don‚Äôt charge it, and I leave the % where it‚Äôs at, and when I go to power it on, it stays where it‚Äôs at. There have been times when I charge it to 100% and it stays on 100% when powering it up the next day. Thank goodness I purchased the AppleCare+ for it just in case the problem really persists.

"I will be listing the main cons of the iTouch as I feel it is more important than the pros when shopping for an item.<br /><br />Background: I have owned the device for the course of a couple of years roughly and have put it through the tests. I use this mainly as a smartphone without the cellular ability because I did not want to pay the extra $30 a month for data plan. This including from surfing the web, to watching videos, chats and emailing.<br /><br />Battery: I have to say, I am connected to Wifi about 90% of the time. It will last me maybe 3-4 hours if I use it constantly to surf the web and YouTube videos. On most days, I could get a full day out of it, but nothing as long I would imagine from advertisement.<br /><br />Camera: as we all know (or should know), it has a 0.7 MP rear camera. Enough said.<br /><br />Quality: To me, the biggest issue (there are many out there with the exact same problem I faced). The home button fail to work after a year of use. It started showing early signs when I would have to press harder for it to go to home or I have to press it down a certain way. It got to a point that I could not deal with it anymore and went to using the gesture mode, which takes up a block on the screen and I accidentally hit it every so often, annoying. Although I have to say, after using it for a year this way, it has become second nature to me and works just as marvelous as the home button.<br /><br />I never abused my hardware. It was always protected in an Otter box.<br /><br />Needless to say. I had stopped using this device months ago since I now own a tablet that works better to my needs. The only time I ever pick this device up is when I know I am going somewhere I cannot take my tablet with me (1 out of 7 days). It's a simple device that does what I need when I need it, but it could be had for a much cheaper and longer battery lasting device.",0.8800000000000001,,0.12903667214012043,,iPad
"This is my first full fledged apple Ipad after finally upgrading from my apple Ipad mini 1st Gen.  What I especially love about this tablet is the full screen edge to edge design.

The sound and colors are great; the sound is clear and crisp even as the tablet is in a case, the colors as vibrant as ever with a natural look option when taking pictures.

"Here is a Jan 21 2012 update.  These minis are all running well.  I started to count my sales for last year (2011)  I sold 97  upgraded  2011  mac minis.  Most were the base model not a one was defective!  Everyone worked out of the box and worked after the mods I did. Three minor problems in all. Two were my fault I loosened the fan wire when modding the mini on one and I had a ssd connector work its way loose after a mod... The third problem was a loose fan connector in a sealed box.  I now load a free program istat widget and check the fan speed first off. I have to say they work at the highest percentage on any mac mini from 2006 up until 2011.<br /><br />Today is Nov 21st an update these minis run really well. I purchased over 50 base models to upgrade and sell all 50 worked and are still working pretty good considering most of my sales are to a famous auction site. No returns speaks for itself. Once you add the 8gb ram they are a very nice piece of gear. I have also been testing them with thunderbolt add-on<br /> storage like the promise pegasus and the lacie little big disk. These options give a mini pretty much endless storage and allow easy upgrade of hdds or ssds externally. My minis are dual booting windows and lion. I would boost to 5 stars but 2gb ram stops me from doing it. Still the durability is remarkable 50 for 50 is amazing for a computer. Most are 44 to 46 good out of 50.<br /><br />First off I buy upgrade and mod mac minis been doing this since 2006.  I have done a lot.  This is the base model I purchased 2 of them.  1 from amazon the other from apple.. The one real flaw is it comes with 2gb ram...  The machine needs at least 4gb ram.  I would say buy 4gb for about 40 bucks or buy 8gb for about 60 bucks.  Search amazon use  , ddr3 8gb ram 1333 ,  for the search  you will get lots of hits.  As for how does it work well with 8gb it is fairly quick in fact its  geekbench test scores are more then 6000 vs 4000 for the 2010 hi end mac mini.  What does this mean?<br /><br /> The CPU is much faster then any older mini.  This allows you to do cpu work quicker.  Handbrake is a popular program it did a 10 minute 1080 p cartoon in 14 minutes using only 40 watts of power.  the fastest older mini does it in 22 minutes using 38 watts.  So if you want to use it for handbrake it is good after you put in some more ram.  Many have said where is the dvd player as it does not have one and you need to add on external one.  Well you do ! so it is another 40 to 60 bucks for one if you need/want it. once again search  {external dvd rom}  on amazon lots of hits.<br /><br />  SO THE RAM ADD ON IS A MUST 4gb or 8gb.  The dvd  is  an optional buy , some people don't need it.<br /><br />Once you add the 4gb or 8gb ram It runs netflix at 720p well.  It runs youTube pretty well at 720p.  I think that is my internet connection not my mini as my mac pro is not much better for youtube!  I would have given  IT 5 stars (if it had 4gb as stock) as I like the small form factor and low power use.  As I said it used 40 watts when doing handbrake and watching a dvd at the same time.  I used kill-a- watt meter to take reading.  What held me back was it does not run well on 2gb of ram. If you buy it with just the stock ram and don't upgrade the ram you will see many spinning beach balls. So 569 at amazon and some ram brings you to  610 or so.  This is the lowest price to get into a real mac with a real osx and not just mobile apps like iPad etc.",0.8400000000000001,,0.15974358974358974,,iPad
"This was a huge upgrade for me coming from a 2012 MacBook Pro. I wanted a desktop computer, but wanted to save some $ and wanted the M1 chip. This latest Mac Mini met both of those for me. My wife thought it was silly to have to buy all the accessories to build around the Mac mini, but that‚Äôs what makes this budget friendly and a bit more customizable. The only other Apple product I bought was the apple track pad 2, which I love, especially coming from a MacBook.<br />My whole set up was about $1100: Mac mini, monitor, speakers, camera, mouse, keyboard, monitor stand. That‚Äôs way cheaper than buying a top spec Mac. You could also build this cheaper than what I paid depending on what accessories you like/need.<br />For performance, it‚Äôs been great! Very smooth. I‚Äôm not a video editor or anything like that. I use it for normal, everyday tasks and business.

"I finally upgraded my iPad Pro 1st gen. This is a very nice upgrade. After 10 years, you can finally have an iPad that will support external drives and a mouse (in fact you can do this with older iPads using iOS 13.4.1). If you want to know if this will replace a conventional laptop, the answer is, it depends. The functionality is closer than ever to a laptop, but you have to ask yourself if the laptop comparison is really fair. Plus there are dozens of ""does the iPad replace a laptop"" YouTube videos out there. I don't use this for work, we have to use our company issued laptops. But all my other computing activities are done on the iPad.<br /><br />The iPad supports Office 360 (word, excel, Notes). Adobe Creative Cloud is well supported. Some things like Turbo Tax seem much better on the iPad.<br /><br />These are not cheap and if you are not completely embedded in the Apple universe maybe you would do better with something else. I can't think of another tech gadget (other than my phone maybe) that I've gotten more use out of.<br /><br />The new Apple Pencil (not included) is nicer than the old round one. Charging/pairing is much better via magnetic induction. While it seems fairly well attached, I'd be afraid of losing it just walking around. I just bought a case for it that has a pencil slot that secures it better.<br /><br />I've ordered the new Magic Keyboard and should have it in a week or two. I'm not sure if I'll like it or not. There does not seem to be any available protective cases you can use while the magic keyboard is attached. My old iPad had the Apple folio keyboard and I found a nice silicone case that fit while the keyboard was attached. There are also some use cases I'm not sure it would work well with (like lying flat veging on TV while rage tweeting with the iPad on my belly).<br /><br />My wife has the previous iPad Pro, the main difference is the new lidar camera. I think that model would do pretty much everything this one does, so maybe that would be a less expensive option. Also as far as memory goes; I got the 256 Gb version. I've never had storage issues unless I'd packed the iPad up with movies for a trip. Now with the 1 TB Samsung T5 SSD drive that should not be a problem.",0.96,,0.14798035298035295,,iPad
After trying other covers (non-apple brand) I have finally found the perfect cover.

"I am still getting into my new ipod touch 64G (4th gen) and absolutely love it! I haven't used the facetime software or all the game features, but still it is a great piece of equipment. Very slick, very easy to use, very slender and cool.<br /><br />However, if you have read all the otehr reviews, you will know that the camera quality is much lower than the iphone camera. I don't think it is as bad as people have said, especially considering how thin it is compared to the new iphone, but you know know about this. Also, it works well as a video/music player (for music, I think the classic is better), but for features that need connectivity (map, e-mail, facetime, online game, etc.), you must make sure to be near accessible and programmed WIFI connections at all times, which is not always easy. But this is a trade off considering an iphone or itouch that you need to decide for yourself.<br /><br />Finally, I am disappointed with the battery life. I can use my 80G ipod classic for almost an entire weekend nonstop without charging (only playing music). My touch seems to need charging after less than 2 hours with some applications. Music will last a full day, depending on use.<br /><br />Otherwise, quite happy and love it!",0.9,,0.1262878787878788,,iPad

"I have two iPads:  this and a sixth generation standard one (maybe three years old). I was looking forward to an upgrade when I bought this. It hasn‚Äôt worked out that way.  The facial recognition does not work as well as the touch button on the older one.  Specifically, the camera is positioned exactly where one would hold the device, so more often than not it‚Äôs covered.  I see no improvement at all in the screen, others than to the size (it‚Äôs a little bigger). The performance of the two devices is exactly the same. Maybe there is a technical tool that would reveal some ‚Äúoh wow‚Äù difference, but for my use it is completely imperceptible.  I favor the older one now and use it more frequently.<br /><br />Bottom line:  if you are looking to buy your first iPad, save your money and buy a cheaper one.

When device had not shipped for three days, i inquired as to why it had not been shipped.  The support person, not of this country, stated that the reason it had not shipped is because i had used the free shipping.  Free shipping is intended not to be as good as paid shipping.  She said that 3-5 days just to be put in the mail is not unreasonable and 7-9 days for delivery is normal following that.  I only live a few hours from the wharehouse it was being shipped from.  That is dumb.  I guess its no wonder that paid shipping is faster when amazon intentionaly delays free shipping.

"Im a big Apple fan, I have an iPhone, used to have an iMac, MacBook Pro, and I've got an iPad. I am very happy with the Apple products I've bought. It's important to know this because it helps give you a frame of reference for my review.<br /><br />As with all Apple products, it's packaged well. There isnt much for instructions on how to use it, but if you go to Youtube you can look at a few 1 minute videos of how to use it. It's easy to charge with the enclosed USB to Lightning cable. The charge port is on the bottom of the mouse so you can't charge it while using it. Thats not much of a problem as I charge my electronics at night while I am sleeping. Its recommended ""per Youtube folks"" that you let it completely discharge before recharging. This brings me to connectivity, the mouse uses Bluetooth on your computer. If you don't have Bluetooth then don't buy the Magic Mouse 2. I charged my mouse overnight and connected it to my MacBook Pro using Bluetooth. There is a switch on the bottom of the mouse that you have to turn on, which is when the switch turns green. Its not an LED, its just painted green so that you know its on. Then I went to settings, I then turned on Bluetooth and the computer paired automatically. The weight of the mouse is heavy as its made of aluminum and I'm sure the battery has some weight to it.<br /><br />Using the mouse is easy. There is the usual right and left clicks. Gesture up and down at the center of the mouse to scroll documents and the internet. One thing you may not like is that the mouse's back end does not fit in the palm of your hand. I don't know why Apple made the mouse streamlined like this but some people may find it a turn off. As for myself, its not a problem as I can deal with it.<br /><br />You can tell that the Magic Mouse 2 is a high quality product. Some folks may be turned off by the high price, but in my opinion you get what you pay for and you won't be disappointed in this product.",0.9400000000000001,,0.09267301587301585,,iPad

I tried each of 4 sizes of ear inserts that were provided and found the ones that fit perfectly.  The loop that goes over the ear holds the phones in place and is completely comfortable.

Very disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è Want Touch ID back.<br />Have been using for 2 days, but no difference between my 2nd generation and this model.<br />Pencil falls off easy, facial recognition only works half the time-you have to hold the pad just right.

"I REALLY love this iPad Pro 11 but had fits figuring out if it really was the super fast newest version with the super wide screen camera and most importantly the A12Z chip... it is. But since the 12.9 inch vers is Gen4 I assumed this wud be too.. no the 2020 Gen 2 is the latest variant in this 11 inch size As of today anyway..<br /><br />Seaking Of size initially I thought this one was a bit small.. it‚Äôs slightly bigger than my old iPad Air, but the display is so sharp it‚Äôs very easy to see and handle it. I love the facial recognition .. it‚Äôs super fast, and surprisingly it even works in a dark room at night with the lights all out..<br /><br />Here‚Äôs the BIG Big problem I encountered tho.. and I‚Äôm telling you this since it could happen to u too.. I  did a Backup And Restore of my Air to this new one using the iTunes App on a Windows 10 PC.. that was simple and fast.. but when I got done.. many of my Apps (about 50 of about 300 of them) which were either free or had been updated using in app purchases later.. simply would not launch or run.. I get an invalid password error.. it took me 4 hours on the phone with Apple Support to figure out apparently these had been purchased under a different Apple ID, and although most still run and work fine on the old iPad Air Gen 2 .. Apple won‚Äôt let them run or Restore as purchases on this new iPad Pro 11 since that old AppleID has been deleted..<br /><br />So what I‚Äôve had to do is try each one and tally all the paid apps up that I‚Äôve lost as a result.. this took 2 days and I have an open case with Apple support  to review the loss for possible compensation or something..since it‚Äôs perfectly legit to have multiple Apple IDs but no one ever told us you can‚Äôt backup then restore them. The free ones are no problem but many were initially free till the kids buy more tokens or features so it‚Äôs several hundred I‚Äôd be out without some way to restore or compensate for this.. I‚Äôm hopeful Apple will compensate for it .. we‚Äôll see and I‚Äôll update this review with the outcome later this week.<br /><br />In spite of this gotcha.. it‚Äôs a fantastic tool.. it‚Äôs super fast and full of new features.. I like it a LOT.<br /><br />updated 7-30:<br />I like this iPad Pro a lot but am now very disappointed in Apple.  I took the guidance of one of their tier two support reps and, because there were so many transferred apps that would not load,  went thru each I paid for and looked them up on the Apple iTunes store an made a screen grab of each to confirm the price to buy it again and went back to Apple support hoping they could restore them... but this time I got a different upper level Support rep and she said flatly that the original rep had reconsidered and they would not be able to help me restore these apps. I was dumbfounded by the 180 degree reversal and asked why they couldn't simply re-activate the AppleID and let me restore what I'd paid for.. Nope all I got was this link in the new AppleID policy.. I can't run any of my old transferred apps tho..  I plan to see if I can take this issue to small claims court and we'll see who's right..<br /><br />https://support.apple.com/kb/HT208504",0.96,,0.18529356060606061,,iPad

"This cover is thin, lightweight, easy to carry, and works well. It holds the iPad at a good angle for ease of typing in landscape mode. The biggest problem is it's impossible to keep clean. Every spot you touch becomes an ugly dust print. I do live in the desert so there's a lot of dust in the air most of the time, but this is ridiculous. I have to clean the cover with a wet rag multiple times a day, it's very hard to remove the dirt, and before I know it, it has new dust prints all over it. Some dust spots won't come off.

"My 16 year old son's high school requires an iPad for all classes. He started out with the iPad 4 but found it bulky to constantly carry around at school. He is used to having his iPhone 6 with him 24/7. When the larger iPad fell out of his backpack in the school parking lot and was accidently run over, we wanted to save a little money by replacing it with a smaller version. This was a great idea and he could not be happier with the iPad Mini 4! He likes that it has all the latest Apple capabilities yet it is smaller and lightweight. He can hold it like a phone and type his homework with his thumbs just like he texts on his phone. This is much faster (for him) than typing with the keyboard on his larger iPad. He also likes that it charges more quickly. This is especially important when he forgets to put it on the charger overnight and it needs it for school the next day.",0.9,,0.2270555555555556,,iPad

What upsets me about it is that when you stand it up at it's high pitch, you can only watch it on a flat surface and cannot touch it without knocking it over. Also, using it's lowest pitch it tends to slip a little and almost falls flat. It works ok on a flat surface but, as most people I know; I use it on the couch.

"I've used Bose Noise Canceling and other AirPods Noise cancelling AirPods - couldn't handle them. Stuffed up my ears after just a few minutes and took days to unstuffy them.  These seem to be different. Perhaps because no active noise cancellation and they sit in the ears rather than being stuffed into them with a tight seal.  Have just had them for a few days, but like them. Sit very steady in my ears and don't feel like they will come out at all.  Ears a bit sore after taking them out but I think that is getting used to them a bit. Will see how that goes. Like how easily they pair with a device (iPad, Apple TV, iMac) as you switch devices.  It would have been nice to have a volume up/down on it vs having to control that by the phone, tv,etc.  When using for telephone use, the other party said they sounded fine and I could hear them fine.

"Normally I do not review products that I do not buy at Amazon, but I am making an exception for the iPad Mini.<br /><br />Let me start by stating that all my gadgetry is Apple.  We own an iMac, iPod nano, two iPhones, and an iPad 3.  Suffice to say: we like Apple products.<br /><br />Honestly, the reason I bought the iPad mini 16G, WiFi was: one, it can fit in one hand; two, it is cheaper than a new iPad; and three, because I wanted it.<br /><br />So:  I've stated that I'm a loyal Apple customer and probably will be the rest of my life.  It might be that I'm biased when it comes to Apple products as are a large majority of Apple customers.<br /><br />I was apprehensive at first about the display.  When I found out the Mini wasn't using a Retina display, I nearly didn't buy one.  I love the beautiful resolution of my iPad 3.<br />Apple used the same 1024-by-768 as the iPad 2, BUT the screen is 7.9 inches.  In my opinion the display resolution is great.  Not iPad 3 great, but not as bad as I thought it would be.  I have to agree with Apple and say that the 7.9 inch screen is perfect for a smaller tablet.  +1 for Mini<br /><br />The Mini is 53% lighter than the iPad and 23% thinner--not a major selling point for me, but not a distraction either.  +1 for Mini<br /><br />The iSight 5 megapixel camera takes great pictures and shoots decent movies for what it is.  I've tried out the FaceTime and it works great--picture resolution is adequate.  +1 for Mini<br /><br />Speed:  The dual-core A5 provides this device with plenty of computing power.  I was impressed as I thought the Mini's speed would suffer as Apple was attempting to cheapen the product a bit.  It didn't.  Internet surfing is lightning fast!  +2 for Mini<br /><br />I'm satisfied with the battery life.  Apple says that the Mini has ten hours of battery life and they're pretty close.  +1 for Mini<br /><br />I love the aluminum unibody cover.  The thing is sweet looking: sleek, like I'm in a sci-fi movie using some futuristic device.  I heard one dude say it's sexy.  I'm not sure that I'd go as far as calling a hunk of aluminum, glass, and plastic sexy, but it is easy on the eyes.  Apple nailed it on the aesthetics of the Mini.  +2 for Mini<br /><br />At first, I was peeved about the Lightning connector (I still am a bit).  All my other devices have the old 30-pin connector.  I have only one cable to charge the Mini and four old cables that will eventually be obsolete.  The smaller port is great though--it looks much better, more compact and I understand why Apple did what they did...but it still sucks when you have multiple other Apple devices with the old port.  Everything has to change sometime, I guess.<br />-1 for Mini (not Apple's fault, my preference)<br />Hey: when the apps and widgets get boring Siri's there to ask millions of important questions to.<br /><br />I used an iBlason case to protect the Mini and so far like it: http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M0QLNUAECSUD/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm<br /><br />So with all that said and much more not mentioned: I'm a fan of the Mini, but I think the device was overpriced a bit.  I still paid the extra $130 over the Kindle Fire HD, because I prefer Apple, but after playing around with a friend's Fire HD 7"", I was impressed with the Fire and the price.<br /><br />In the end it was a matter of preference for me choosing Apple over Kindle.  I'm very satisfied with my purchase of the Mini and my kids love it too.  I would recommend the Mini to anyone and everyone.  Great product!<br /><br />*Update 11-20-12<br /><br />It has been several weeks of heavy use for the Mini and I have very little negative to say about the device.  Again, I bought it because it was Apple and for the Apps and because I like Apple products.<br /><br />I wish the external speakers were a little louder, but one can use headphones and be fine.  For our family uses the A-5 processor is adequate.  The device seems to stream the Time Warner App without buffering or glitches--I really cannot complain.<br /><br />Our Mini is used on and off all day long starting with a fully charged battery in the morning and about 10-15% life at bedtime (9:00pm-10:00pm).  That's using mostly gaming Apps and some video streaming.  For us, that's about right.  If a device's battery can make it through the day, I'm fine with that.",1.0,,0.24449922014260247,,iPad

"Good investment. Almost like a laptop computer. If you NEED this, invest in it. It's worth it. When I was researching about this product there is so much emphasis on how this ipad bends easily. However, if you get a sturdy and decent case to protect your ipad from bending, like a plastic/leather case (one I have) you most likely will not have to worry about the bending problem. Also, it depends on you, how you take care of your ipad. If you're the person to carelessly drop things, then you would do well to be careful about this ipad since it can be a bit fragile or you could just get an even sturdier case. But there's nothing to be afraid of. This ipad is one of the best investments you will ever make and should last you for many, many years. Even then it is reasonably sturdy on it's own.

"Review update from the original post<br /><br />As far as cases go, I was going to initially try out the Apple SmartCase, but for $80, I thought I should at least check out what else was available.  I found this case that was similar in design but a bit more stylish and a lot cheaper.  Actually I was a little worried about it being so cheap on Amazon, but the reviews were good so I figured I'd give it a shot.  Turns out I had nothing to worry about.  Case seems to function just as well as Apples and it actually seems a bit sturdier.  It's made from synthetic materials instead of leather like the Apple case, but I like it even better.  Seems like it would be easier to clean (especially handy for when my kids get their hands on it) and just feels easier to grip for me.  At least that's my opinion.  You should check it out.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/iPad-Air-Case-Landscape-Generation/dp/B00OKUBFNC/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1415224806&sr=1-1&keywords=roocase+optigon+air+2<br /><br />Though it's only been a week since my initial review, I've been taking the iPad Air 2 to test out its capabilities further, much to the dismay of my family.  But as I mentioned earlier, I do have a windows tablet (8"" version) that I had been using as a supplement to my work computer.  I sometimes need to view spreadsheets, powerpoints or word docs away from the office and if it's just to check something or make a minor edit, it can be a major pain to pull out my full, work issued laptop.  I thought having full windows in a portable, as-needed, format was convenient.  But since I've been reading that the iPad is more productivity oriented in its present form, I had to see how it compared.  Especially since, I would have the convenience of the other tablet strengths of the iPad to boot.<br /><br />So far I'm impressed.  I've been using MS Office for iPad and I have to say that in many ways, it's even better than Office is on a small windows tablet.  I think the iPad version is more suited to a touch screen whereas the windows version still feels like they expect you to use a mouse.  I think the key is having the right Bluetooth keyboard and a good stand case for the iPad Air 2, especially when it comes to editing a complicated formula in an excel file.<br /><br />For the time being, I've been using a no-name, compact keyboard I had originally bought for the old iPad 2.  It came built into a case but of course that case doesn't fit the new iPad.  But luckily, the keyboard portion was removable.  I never liked having the keyboard attached when I wasn't using it anyway.  I will continue to try to find a better one as this one just feels a little too mushy for me.<br /><br />So far the iPad Air 2 is exceeding my expectations.  I just figured the old iPad we had was getting too old and needed replacing.  But, I'm quickly discovering that all the incremental improvements made between each generation has added up to a device that is pushing new ground for what a tablet is meant to be.  Like I mentioned in my review, I've tried a lot of different tablets, including Asus Transformer Pad with keyboards.  Even my older iPad didn't cut it as a productivity device.  But this new iPad is just faster and smoother making trying to get a little work done a lot less frustrating without giving up on anything that has made the iPad so convenient.<br /><br />-------------<br /><br />Original Post<br /><br />I've tried many different tablets including iPads, various Android tablets from older 10.1"" Honeycomb versions to the most recent Nexus 7 and even a Windows 8.1 tablet.  I originally started with the iPad 2 and it was the device that convinced me that tablets were worth the investment and served a useful purpose.  From there I tried several Android tablets.  It actually took that platform quite a while to catch up to the benchmark the iPad had set.  I started with a honeycomb tablet that required a lot of patience as bugs were worked out.  I ended up having to root it and try some custom roms to get the tablet to work the way I expected it to and even then it wasn't uncommon for the device to crash on me.  But eventually, Google was able to improve the OS and by the time the second generation Nexus 7 came out, they had finally achieved a truly usable device.<br /><br />As for Windows tablets, I don't really see them as an iPad competitor.  They are more like a miniature version of your PC you can take along with you in place of a full size laptop.  Sure the Metro interface does make it more tablet-like, but the lack of apps and reliance on the desktop screen keeps it from being that ""even a child can figure it out,"" used by everybody in that family, zero learning curve device.<br /><br />So while I've gone back and forth with devices, being the gadget geek that I am, my family and I have always had an iPad around when we wanted to quickly play a game, use an app or watch a video.  So when the new iPad Air 2 came out, I decided it was time bring home a new iPad.<br /><br />The thing I love most about the iPad is that it is so simple to use and no matter what you want to do, there is probably an app for it.  As fine a job Android has done playing catch up, there has never been an app that I wanted that I couldn't find in the App Store.  This used to be especially true for apps that gave you access to accounts you might have with a broker, an institution or a company.  It's not too much of an issue anymore since most companies now release both IOS and Android apps simultaneously.  I've even seen a few Android apps come out before the IOS version, but this wasn't always the case.  I think there are still a few companies that will still put more effort into their IOS release than they do Android.<br /><br />Holding the new iPad Air 2 in my hand I can see that Apple still sets the standard for the category of device they invented.  You might even say that the interface hasn't changed much from the original device they launched in 2010.  Sure there have been a lot of incremental improvements like the pull down notifications, additional gestures, and the ability to create folders to clean up the pages.  But, there was never a need for Apple to have a Project Butter initiative to improve the smoothness of how the device functioned because Apple had gotten it right from the start.  Each incremental improvement Apple has introduced has merely brought a very good system closer to perfection.<br /><br />I think they even got the screen size right.  Though the first iPad was a bit weighty, the 9.7"" screen size has always been perfect. While Android and other have set 10.1"" with a wide screen ratio as their standard and dabbled with even larger screen sizes, I have always found the 9.7"" 4:3 ratio to be the perfect portable size for a tablet.  Even when you compare a 10.1"" Android tablet next to the iPad, though there isn't much of a difference in screen size, the iPad seems much more portable while still giving the illusion that the screen is just as big if not bigger.  Now that they have reduce the size of the bezel further and increased the resolution, the current screen is absolutely stunning.  Going in the other direction, while I've never owned the iPad Mini myself, the 7.9"" screen with the 4:3 ratio to me just seems to be a lot easier to read from than the smaller 7"" screens with a 16:9 ratio that have become the standard for smaller Android tablets.<br /><br />As for the weight and thinness of the current iPad, it is just unbelievable.  Comparing the new iPad to some of the older devices I have lying around is like comparing a Macbook Air or Ultrabook to the old HP laptops I use to have to carry around.  Honestly, picking up my backpack, I have to double check that I packed my iPad because there is no way I can tell by the weight whether it's in there or not.<br /><br />The interface is so much smoother now with the faster chip.  There is never even a hint of lag and pages load instantaneously.<br />As the iPads wider ecosystem has evolved, it has even become capable of some limited productivity.  Add a Bluetooth keyboard and attach a nice stand case and you can actually do some work.  Microsoft Office Apps and iMovie have given it the ability to create documents, spreadsheets and videos.<br /><br />Not that the iPad is perfect.  The device seems to vibrate when you put it on maximum volume.  It's still not as customizable as the Android interface.  But it's still the closest I've seen so far to the perfect tablet experience.",0.9199999999999999,,0.196120833461259,,iPad

"These are great and all but for $150+, no way, not worth it.  I just received these as a gift for my BDAY from my GF and prior to this I was using the TaoTronics Bluetooth earbuds, similar to the PowerBeats2 and I can honestly say that the quality and sound are very much comparable.  There's no way I can justify the price difference and I'd much rather purchase the TaoTronics Bluetooth earbuds over these at $20ish.<br /><br />I guess the only benefit I'd give these over the other Bluetooth ear buds is that these have the hooks to go over the ear to help the earbuds from falling out and staying in place - so it's really suited for those who have rigorous workouts and cardio.  I've always thought the 'Beats' brand was over-rated and you're really just paying for the marketing and branding of these earbuds.  Besides that, there's nothing else that make these more worthwhile then the other more affordable ear buds.  Even my skullcandy inkd 2 wired earbuds sound better than these.<br /><br />UPDATE 10/3/2015 - So I changed out the earbud ends to the larger ones it came with and wow they made a huge difference.  The sound is much better, cleaner, and deeper since the earbuds now fit much more snug in my ear canal and there is much less sound leak.  I still wouldn't pay $150 for these but the sound quality has definitely improved after switching out the earbud ends.",0.82,,0.26183908045977017,,iPad

"Love it for drawing and some kids educational apps but not much else so far.  I do a lot of art and 3d sculpting and procreate has been amazing for drawing but I can't bring myself to use the 3d sculpting apps.  They are pretty bad at the moment.  I still use my phone for most podcast, youtube, and kindle reading due to the smaller size and always with me.  I still use my desktop pc for most computer tasks due to getting full blown versions of things and more web capabilities(even google docs is way better on a PC).  I still use my big TV for casting media.  So, for our family it's a great drawing and kids educational tablet.  Still very worth it but not even close to a computer replacement....and we have the magic keyboard as well.<br /><br />The lack of user profiles also hinders its use a lot.  I want this to be a family device and I feel like the face detection should recognize all of us and show the layout and apps we want based on that.  All of our apple and google accounts should be signed into based on who is using the iPad. I find it really strange to have a high end computer like device that can't handle multiple users.<br /><br />Mouse support also isn't that great.  The big mouse icon is nice but the actual click area can have a lot of problems.  You can keep clicking on something but the software doesn't think you are.  Seems like it's still just a tiny pinpoint of a click area hidden underneath a large mouse icon.  Also lots of your day to day basic apps hardly support it.

"Ok. I splurged for the first time in years and caved into buying an IPad Pro 12.9"" at full price.  I have mixed feelings.  The bitterness comes from the price I paid for it and the guilt associated with it... This model is without a question an improvement over its predecessors but is it worth the extra $$$$.  This model does not come with a home button and the earlier users of the iPad may find that it takes some getting used to.  A short training session solves this problem.  The display resolution is good @ 2732x2048 but can be better.  The size feels a little like holding a laptop and it is definitely something you will not want to take with you when you go on a vacation.  Others may disagree with me...  The amount of RAM is 6GB.  There is definitely room for improvement here.  Why not at least 8GB of RAM or why not 16GB?  As far as the storage is concerned, none of the iPads in this day of age should come with anything less than 512GB.  ideally, 1TB should be the minimum standard storage for all iPads.  It is nice to see 4 speakers but who listens out of these speakers?  I always use a headphone but when you search for it on this model iPad you will not find a built in headphone jack.  Instead, you have a buy a USB-C to 3.5 mm Headphone Jack adapter.  It is $7.99 on Amazon.  You can't help but ask yourself the question, why did Apple not include this adapter in the box?  Would it kill them to add something like this in the box?  It probably costs less than a buck to manufacture something like this and Apple won't give it to you for free.  It is their executive and sales and marketing mentality that truly gets on my nerves!  Ok, I am moving on... The camera has a 12MP resolution and still years behind where it should be.  At this price range, I am expecting a minimum 20MP resolution.  The video recorder at 4K is satisfactory for now and will be for several years to come for most people.  So, no complaints here... The LIDAR scanner may be over the top for most people but it does not hurt to have... External storage capability is nice but it would have been nicer to include a USB-C to USB external flash drive 64GB or higher in the box.  The wireless external storage connectivity is also nice... My biggest complaint is Apple's Corporate sales and marketing philosophy where they are extremely stingy with their products considering the prices the consumers pay for these products.  Would it kill them to include a headphone adapter?  Would it kill them to include an extra charging adapater?  Would it kill them to include a extra external storage as a good jesture to their customers?  These are the types of things that truly anger me!  It is the greed!",0.96,,0.14260416666666664,,iPad

"I picked up the iPad Air 2 locally as soon as it was available.  I have owned tons of tablets and convertibles laptops.  i owned both the iPad 1 and iPad 2. Below are some of my thoughts on the iPad Air 2 and how it compares to the competition.<br /><br />‚úî PROS:<br /><br />- A thin, light design<br />- A great HD display<br />- Faster than its predecessors<br />- Among the best cameras you will find in a tablet<br />- The best ecosystem of any mobile platform<br />- Often enjoys better enterprise support than other tablets<br />- iOS 8 Continuity features such as Handoff, Phone Calling, Instant Hotspot, and SMS<br />- Touch ID works 99% of the time<br /><br />‚úî CONS:<br /><br />- No SD Card Slot<br />- No USB or HDMI ports, although lightning cable adapters are available<br />- A tad big if portability is a requirement<br />- More expensive than comparable tablets, including the iPad Air 1<br />- Lower capacity battery than the iPad Air 1<br />- Marginal update over the $100 cheaper iPad Air 1<br /><br />‚úî IPAD AIR 2 vs NEXUS 9<br /><br />Neither the iPad Air 2 nor the Nexus 9 (nor the SAMSUNG GALAXY TAB S) offers much to convince you to switch platforms.  If you are undecided on the platform to choose, choose the iPad if you want the best ecosystem, better tablet centric experience, ease of use for non-sophisticated users, and better enterprise support.  Choose the Nexus 9 for a customizable OS, a more techie centric OS, widgets (come on, Apple!!!), or if you make great use of Google Apps.  And as much as I like the Apple Siri App, I much prefer Google Now.<br /><br />Basically, if I‚Äôm buying a tablet for me or my techie little brother, I‚Äôm buying an Android Tablet.  For my parents, my grandparents, or my kids I‚Äôm buying an iPad... or a Kindle. ;-)<br /><br />‚úî IPAD AIR 2 vs WINDOWS TABLETS<br /><br />Unless you need to run desktop apps on your tablet, you will be happier with an iPad over any Windows Tablet.  The iPad has a much better tablet centric experience at this point.  Perhaps Windows 10 will change that.  For now, Windows Tablets currently see a big gap in terms of usability, available tablet apps, and price/performance ratios.<br /><br />‚úî IPAD AIR 2 vs KINDLE FIRE HDX 8.9<br /><br />IPad users enjoy probably the best ecosystem of apps, accessories, and exclusive content.  Niche apps are often made first for, or are exclusive to iOS.  iPads have seen more support in the enterprise and in educational institutions.  In addition to all of this, iPads are also great devices.  If you have a Mac, use an iPhone, require apps or content exclusive to iOS, are already invested in iTunes purchases, or any combination of the above, you are probably better off getting an iPad.<br /><br />However, if you are open to considering another device, the Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 should be at the top of your list.  It‚Äôs a great device, it‚Äôs cheaper than a new iPad, and offers a lot in terms of ecosystem and optional benefits.<br /><br />Ultimately, I chose the HDX 8.9 over the iPad because I‚Äôm an Amazon Prime Member and I enjoy having access to so much ‚Äúfree‚Äù content.<br /><br />‚úî IPAD AIR 2 vs IPAD AIR 1<br /><br />The iPad Air 2 is the best iPad ever.  It‚Äôs faster, thinner, has more ram, and has a better camera than the iPad Air 1.  It also has Touch ID which, to me, is the biggest enhancement the Air 2 has over the Air 1.<br /><br />I‚Äôm not certain that the iPad Air 2 is $100 better than the iPad Air 1, however.<br /><br />The iPad Air 1 is also a great device.  For many people, I‚Äôd recommend getting an iPad Air 1 32GB and save $50 over getting the iPad Air 2 16GB.  If you have an ‚ÄúiPad 3‚Äù, you should probably keep using it until the ‚ÄúiPad Air 3‚Äù comes out.  Other than guys I know who are willing to pay for the latest and greatest gadget, I don‚Äôt know for who I would recommend the Air 2 over Air 1.<br /><br />‚úî BOTTOM LINE<br /><br />As I said above, the iPad Air 2 is the best iPad ever.  I just have a hard time recommending it over the $100 cheaper iPad Air 1.  Touch ID and the improved camera are great.  But are they $100 great?  Answer that and you‚Äôll be able to decide which among them you will choose.  Yes, Air 2 is faster but most people won‚Äôt notice the difference.<br /><br />I‚Äôll be re-gifting my iPad Air 3 (I planned to do this before buying it).  I have a loved-one that will appreciate having the latest and greatest iThing.  For me, I still prefer Android over iOS.  The 4th gen Kindle Fire HDX 8.9, coupled with an Amazon Prime subscription, is still my top tablet choice.  The Nexus 9 and Galaxy Tab 4 S would be next on the list.<br /><br />The nice thing is, whether you choose an iPad, Kindle, Nexus, or Galaxy Tab, you are going to get a great device!  Leave the tablet wars to the fan boys and enjoy which ever tablet you choose.",0.9199999999999999,,0.3777785293410294,,iPad

It seems they're bringing this incremental change over to the ipad as well. There is NOTHING thats better than the 2018 ipad pro other than the new lidar sensor and ultrawide lens.

"Thanks in part to this product, I am a cord cutter  -- or a cord loosener at least-- that is, someone who is weaning the household off Comcast.  We've scaled back our cable TV package after going nearly full time to Internet-supplied video. The programs we would normally ""miss"" by not paying through the nose for various tiers of channels (most of which we would never use) are largely available through other non-cable means including iTunes.  What we can't find on Netflix or Hulu or Tv.com, we can usually find on iTunes for purchase, as well as back episodes and full seasons.  Even while purchasing some of these a la carte now, we spend a fraction of what we did. The reason this works is that the Apple cable does a pretty decent job of feeding our downloads into the HDTV, complete with good sound quality (TV is tethered to home stereo).  The component cable works noticeably better than the composite-cable version we had before (and now use on the road).  It is not perfect picture, but serviceable for certain.  In addition to iTunes, we still rely on DVDs (mostly netflix rentals or a few purchases of favorites) for highest quality sound and picture experience. In addition, we cabled a laptop to the HDTV and using WiFi can stream a wealth of content options. DVDs, downloads,and streaming -- the three main tools of cord cutting.

I bought them for the hearing aid feature and I saved thousands over standard aids. They work very well for me but may not for everyone. You can custom tune them for six frequencies which is adequate for me. Hearing aids can be customized for many more frequencies and may be necessary for some people.

When I plugged my headphones into the iPad, I first heard nothing. After jiggling the plug-in-socket, I could get intermittent sound so long as I pressed hard on the plug. Minute I let up, the sound broke up or vanished. Tried three different sets of headphones. Same story. Tried all four sets of headphones on my PC: all work flawlessly. Amazon agreed to let me return the item but not replace it for the same item: I want this iPad; I just want one that works. Fair but disappointing response from Amazon. Good device!

"Even though I do not like Apple products as a general rule, I purchased this product because I believed that it was the best tablet on the market. I was wrong. The software and device management policies are the worst I have ever seen from a tech company that claims they know what they are doing. They obviously do not. Their bluetooth keyboard (which does not have an on/off switch), became active in my backpack and connected to the iPad while I was walking. It was entering characters the entire time and once it entered the wrong password the device locked. Permanently. The only way to get it to unlock is to connect it to a computer and reset the entire device. All of my videos from my trip are now gone before I had a chance to upload them to Dropbox when I got home. I paid more for the 512GB version so that I wouldn't have to pay a ridiculous amount of money each year for cloud storage to use their awful iCloud service. So now because I didn't give them more of my money I have been punished by their device policy and I certainly will never purchase another Apple product in my life.",0.96,,-0.08015873015873015,,iPad

"I think this is the best ""portfolio"" style case for the iPad.  It is slim and functional.  It adds virtually no weight or bulk to the iPad and protects it from scratches and minor drops, which is all I need.<br /><br />I don't find the edge of the case any problem.  When I carry it, my hand is long the smooth spine of the case (not the open edged end).  I don't know why people would carry it any other way, so I'd discount any complaints about the ""sharp"" edge on the other 3 sides (which BTW isn't all that ""sharp"" to begin with).<br /><br />The case does not stand vertically, but none of the portfolio style cases do either.  Set up horizontally is easy by just slipping the front of the case into a little slot on the back.  There's only one height, but it's a perfect height for viewing and touch screen use while seated.<br /><br />The suede texture of the case feels very nice.  Feels very nice in the hands when viewing the iPad vertically. Just got mine and can't comment on dirt or wear, but the cover is washable (w/a damp sponge) and I don't see this as a major problem.

I bought this product used from Amazon for half the price in like-new condition. I'm very pleased with the quality of the smart cover and really enjoy not having to unlock the screen after I open the cover. It works nicely to prop up the iPad for reading in landscape mode. It's stayed surprisingly clean for being a light brown color after a few months of usage. I'm using this product with the new iPad and it's worked great. I paired this with the Belkin snap shield and it's been a great combo so far. The belkin snap shield's metal tab on the back is great for holding the smart cover in the open position.,0.76,,0.3008785332314744,,iPad

"I laughed recently when I was told about an outlaw (an in-law's in-law) who read my wife the riot act because we use Apple products. It took me back to the time a number of years ago that I did the same to people who chose Macs over PCs. That was in the days before iPhones and iPads, even before iPods. At the time, it seemed that everybody except a few college students was using machines that ran on windows.  I remember bragging about how great my laptop was and what I could do with it.<br /><br />Fast forward to today, when we use an iMac at home, iPads for a variety of tasks and I carry an iPhone. I have gone through a succession of MacBooks, from a basic MB to a MB Pro that I loved. I had reached the place, however, that I just carried my iPad with me in a nice Zagg case with keyboard. I wasn't sure I would ever carry a laptop again.<br /><br />My travel got bumped up a bit this year and I found some weakness with my iPad.  I'm a touch typist who found that the loss of my bluetooth keyboard or airplanes was more than a small disruption.  I was also missing some robust software that just couldn't be matched by the company's IOS app.  Therefore, I decided to try out the 11.6-Inch MB Air.  Here is what surprised me:<br /><br />1. This Air is so small and light that I have no problem carrying it and my iPad with a smart cover.  The weight gain from this little computer is negligible.<br />2.  My former MB Pro had 8 GB of memory and I was concerned that this one only had 4GB. The updated processor and the SSD drive make the new computer significantly faster.<br />3.  The keyboard is full-size and helps me stay focused on the screen, where my work is taking place.<br />4. The display itself, though small, is just enough workspace for the word-crunching that I do.<br /><br />For those who are considering a migration from windows, imagine life without the &#34;blue screen of death.&#34;  Think about the ease of document management between your laptop and those other i-devices you probably already have.  When people ask me today why I love a particular Apple product,  I usually say, &#34;It just works!&#34;  Try one and see.",0.6799999999999999,,0.1421362863327149,,iPad

"I'm currently using a 15&#34; late 2013 retina MBP.  It's a little big and heavy for traveling. The Macbook makes a great travel computer with a few limitations.

It takes a little getting used to the narrower spacing of the keys.<br />Very sharp screen, reasonable bright, amazing battery life. At full brightness 4-5 hrs of streaming video, about 2x of the MBPR<br />You can drive a single 4K monitor with the $49 HDMI dongle.

The 12&#34; screen is barely large enough to be productive but works well with spaces.<br /><br />Bad.<br />One USB-C port.

"I absolutely loved my old airpods... so, why wouldn't I give the new ones a chance?  I gave my old airpods to my niece, and I'm thinking about stealing that candy back from the baby.

I'll take them out of the fully-charged case, and low-and-behold the damn things didn't charge... nothing obstructing the airpods in the case.  Sometimes they are fully-charged, I take them out... and they do not connect.  Sometimes they pop up on the screen, indicating they are connected, but fail to connect.  Gotta turn everything off and on.  Do you think Apple backs up their product?  Hell no, they are only interested in producing more plastic for the ocean.

"I bought this case at the same time I purchased my IPad. It was highly recommended by the sales staff and although I was somewhat hesitant to purchase it, I did so anyway...now I can't imagine my IPad without this protective case.<br /><br />The Positives:<br /><br />1.)This case has a nice snug fit...initially making it a bit difficult to insert the IPad for the first time, but the good thing is, that it tends to make it almost impossible for the IPad to slip out of this case, should it be turned upside down.<br /><br />2.)The material used has a pleasant tacky feel (almost like a suede) making it very easy and comfortable to hold on to. The bare IPad is fairly smooth and slippery so this jacket provides just the right amount of frictional surface to allow for a secure grip whether your holding the IPad in your hands or have it on your lap.<br /><br />3.)The case folds back on itself so as to form a 'stand' for your IPad...so you can sit your IPad on a flat surface. The sitting angle is at 70 degrees (measured) making it easy to read a book, or use with another i-device, such as a wireless keyboard.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />A snug, well made and reasonably priced* case to protect your IPad.  5 Stars.<br /><br />Ray Nicholson<br /><br />P.S.<br />*I believe this product is cheaper priced at the Apple Store.",0.86,,0.20968671679197995,,iPad

"It seems like the iPods have been around forever, and until now I resisted getting one because I really didn't think I'd use it very much. I don't carry a music player around with me, or use one at the gym, etc., so I felt I had no need for one. But, I have around 150 CDs, and probably 90% of them sit in my house unplayed, because I play CDs mostly in my car, and I'm not in the habit of changing them out very much. Well, I finally decided to rip all of the tracks off of ALL my CDs, and I'm going to put them all on my new 64GB iPod. I'll use the MP3 jack in my car and have access to my entire collection at my fingertips, while I drive. I'm also getting Apple tv, and I'll stream music from my iPod, wirelessly, to my tv with a surround sound system. This will give me access to my whole collection, any song in an instant, both at home and in the car. So, I could not resist the iPod any longer!! I'm glad I didn't -- it's a very cool little device. Very sleek and slim - hard to believe it can hold so much music. I'll also enjoy recording HD video with my iPod, along with all of the apps that I've barely begun to explore.

I actually can barely wait until I get the Apple 27 inch Display for this Mac Mini, and then via Thunderbolt it will be heaven thats for sure.<br />I also noticed that my audio has changed and is so much better then on the Dell XPS. Apple is sure the best every way you look at it :)<br /><br />I cannot say anything bad about this little monster, but upgrade the RAM to 8GB, its so worth it :)<br />I honestly don't think that the $799 Mac Mini is worth the extra $200 for a slightly faster CPU and a dedicated ATI GPU. This Intel HD 3000 has really surprised me, because I remember all those old integrated graphics from the 90's and 2000's, so this puppy is superb!!!!!<br /><br />Don't wait and get this Mac Mini, and you will be in heaven just like I am right now as I am writing this review :)<br />Go Buy One Now!!!

"So, as I said in the title. I have had bluetooth earphones before, but the sound quality always seemed better with wired phones instead of bluetooth. But, I found these on sale and thought I'd give them a try. If I didn't like them I'd just return them.<br /><br />Man, was I wrong. These are better than any wired noise cancellation earphones I've ever had.<br /><br />The integration between my iPhone and iPad is awesome. I can switch between the iPad and the iPhone seamlessly. And the ability to switch between noise cancellation and non noise cancellation with the earphones themselves is a great added benefit. If I want to have noise cancellation I can just tap the right earphone and I hear almost nothing. If I want to be able to talk to people or hear what is going on around me I can also just tap again and it switches to non noise cancellation.<br /><br />This is a game changer, for me, for ear phones.<br /><br />Also, on charging.... The charging unit holds a good amount of charge. I was on a flight recently and the earphones went down to 5%. I put them in the charging case and after 5 mins of charging I had another hour of earphone use. Got me to my destination.<br /><br />The charging case does incredibly well at charging these super fast.<br /><br />I can't find a single complaint.",0.96,,0.27012138188608775,,iPad
"I love everything about this iPad especially the color. It was easy to sync all of the items from the old iPad to this one. The only issue is that there is a particular program on the computer to download in order to sync the music and it is not iTunes. Someone had mentioned it on the Apple Website.<br /><br />However, I love this anyway. The new unlocking is easy when you just use the touch ID instead of using a passcode. It has a bigger hard drive, so I am able to access programs better. It has good sound, the HDR camera looks better, and, well, what more can I say?<br /><br />The downside to this is when first getting it, there may be a few software updates and the user has to make sure they have the latest version of ITunes. Sometimes the new software will give the Apple products issues, but I have not run into any of these problems with this iPad.<br /><br />This iPad had somewhat replaced the laptop due to its portability and quickness in getting Wi-Fi signals. Have not experimented to add it to cell phone plan but will look into that more. This is a great buy, especially if you would like to upgrade an iPhone or iPad or need something to sync from a compatible laptop",0.9,,0.28613053613053613,,iPad

"From a hardware point of view, the 4th Gen touch is a nicely thought out device that combines a capable media player with good PDA functionality. Issues on the hardware side are minor: as others have noted, the camera is merely bearable and, while slim and shiny look good, they are also hard to hold and easy to drop.<br /><br />But good hardware needs software. After installing iTunes 10 on my very quick Windows 7 machine, initial sync with MS Outlook contacts and calendar was seamless - Ironically you can't do this with MS's own Zune. Then I added my music collection. You probably think a 64GB media player would be capable of syncing about 2000 music tracks. Silly goose - not with iTunes. After about 24 hours of `determining gapless playback information' with no end in sight, no music had been synced - not a single track. I've uninstalled, reinstalled, and disabled just about every option I can find - yet it still takes 3 to 5 minutes just to open a menu or select a view in iTunes. I will experiment with iTunes alternatives - let the weeks of trouble shooting begin.",0.9,,0.15582706766917293,,iPad

"My iPad MW6J2LL/A 7th generation with LTE modem, compared to the old Ipads I have had in the past, I am super impressed.  I purchased the ""base model"" 32 GB storage capacity.  I purchased at my local Verizon store.  Build quality and overall feel of the device is great.  I would definitely reccommend getting a case as soon as possible, as I am always nervous about accidental drops with Apple's products (they are not very ""ruggedized"").<br /><br />The iPad this model it at this time it is fast and seems to be able to do everything I need with it.  I wouldn't go so far as to say it will 100% replace a PC or a Mac Laptop for ALL needs, as Apple advertises, but it is darn close.<br /><br />I have a keyboard case that I purchased with the Ipad and that adds $100 or so to the price.<br /><br />Having the LTE modem built in is wonderful.  I am able to get a good signal in most all of the buildings where I work.<br /><br />Having the integration across devices that Apple offers with all of their products is convenient.<br /><br />I recently had to contact Apple support and they stayed with me on the chat line until my issue was resolved.<br /><br />Compared to my older iPad devices this particular model at this time it is super fast.<br /><br />It is also nice with Apple devices to not be required to re-purchase old software that I purchased for older devices.<br /><br />At this time I have no regrets about the purchase of this particular model and I am overall very pleased with the experience.",0.9400000000000001,,0.2361111111111111,,iPad

"Typically I purchase just what I think I need and nothing extra. But after several years I'm usually regretting I skimped and then I end up spending more buying something else because I didn't spend sufficient money originally. This time I did just the opposite. I got the best I could. I'm leaving the country for four years and I have no doubt that this will be sufficient for me the entire time. After all, I've been using my iPad 3 for three years with just 16 gb of memory and have done great with it until iOS 8. Now I'm regretting I didn't get a little more memory. So this time I got 128, which will likely be overkill. But I expect that it will handle later generation operating systems and apps for a longer time because of it. Plus all of my pictures and stuff. Go for the best. It's worth it and you won't go wrong with such a high quality piece of equipment. And I am NOT an Apple fan. I have an Android phone and a Windows PC.

"[[VIDEOID:f94abfaf8c2c92ac10f125319da6fd18]] Hi everyone,<br /><br />I attached an unboxing video in hopes that you get an idea of what comes in the box. I have been playing around with the iPad for around 4-5 hours and I will give you my review comparing two different iPads. I am also setting a reminder to update my response in 30 days and then I will re-update everything when classes begin.<br /><br />I want to preface this by saying I purchased this iPad for class and everyday use. Anyways, I will be comparing the IPad (4th generation) and the new IPad Pro 11. There isn‚Äôt much for me to talk about, since I haven‚Äôt owned the IPad for a long period of time, so I will be comparing: responsiveness, sound quality, and the infamous Apple Pencil (2nd generation).<br /><br />Responsiveness:<br /><br />iPad (4th Generation)-<br /><br />This is still a great iPad in my eyes, but when you are comparing how quickly you can move from screen to screen, or the ease of using shortcuts, it doesn‚Äôt compare to the pro.<br /><br />vs.<br /><br />iPad Pro 11-<br /><br />Within the first few hours I enjoy how quickly I can move from app to app and screen to screen. Yet again, I am still in the first few hours, so my opinion may change within the next thirty days.<br /><br />Sound Quality:<br /><br />iPad (4th generation)-<br /><br />I don‚Äôt have much to say about the sound quality of the 4th gen. I love watching YouTube videos on it, and it gets me from point A to point B.<br /><br />iPad Pro 11-<br /><br />I‚Äôm a fan of how loud this thing is. Of course, I will probably never have it at max volume, but it is nice knowing that I have the option to do so.<br /><br />I watched a few reviews before purchasing the iPad, and apparently there is a difference between the 10.5, 11, and 12.9 iPad pros volume (I know, I know, duh). So, if sound quality/volume is your thing, I would go for the 12.9. I never listen to audio on my iPad, so it wasn‚Äôt a big deal to me.<br /><br />Is it worth it to purchase the Apple Pencil (2nd generation)?<br /><br />As of right now, I can‚Äôt really say and have nothing to compare it against. So far I will say that I enjoy using the pencil within the notability app, and I like double tapping the pen and it swapping from pencil to eraser. And the ability to charge the pen by simply attaching it to the side of the iPad is icing on the cake.<br /><br />Overall, the IPad Pro is phenomenal and I would choose it over the 4th generation anyday. Will this thought change? Maybe; maybe not. But I intend on updating this review in thirty days, and I will be sure to add battery life (both the iPad and pencil) and a list of cons to my full review.<br /><br />If this review/unboxing video was helpful, please let Amazon know by clicking the helpful button below. It would make my day!",0.96,,0.16911169970380496,,iPad

"I've used several other stand cases before finally coming back to the original OEM case.  The case I first purchased was the same design as the OEM case but in black leather.  This gave a great refined look but also added a lot of thickness.  It also had a wider bottom fold in the stand/cover, making it very stable in the upright (video) position, but a bit too upright in the typing position.<br /><br />My next case was a leather slip case with two-position picture-frame style stand  on the back, allowing for it to stand in either portrait or landscape orientation.  This wasn't nearly as useful as it sounds and I very rarely stood it up in portrait mode.  Also, due to the lack of a front cover, I reverted to my previous case for travel.<br /><br />I finally picked up the OEM case (now reduced to about 1/2 the original price) after becoming tired of the added thickness of the leather cases.  The OEM cover adds the bare minimum in terms of added thickness while maintaining the full functionality of the fold-back stand design.

"I was looking through the poor reviews and I recommend them to everyone looking for a laugh. It consists mainly of people whining about their own clumsiness or illiteracy and Apple refusing to pay for it. My iPod works perfectly and arrived a day early. I've worked all summer for the money, and it was well worth it. It was exactly as advertised, and for the record, is not a children's toy. It will break when you drop it from a fair height and everyone knows that. With the new iPod 5 out, yes, there will be a few apps that won't work with it, but there is absolutely no use whining about it. There are plenty of games and apps that do work, and so what if it crashes to the home screen sometimes? Just turning it off to close other apps makes it run better.<br />All in all, it is a great device, that arrived early and in good condition. I recommend buying cases as soon as possible.

In fact, it's easier on the mini than the iPad because Procreate's palm rejection isn't that good.

Apple is soooo overrated.  Mediocre design.,0.9,,-0.5,,iPad
"This is possibly Apple's laziest design ever - they just took the iPad style adapters and swapped lightning for USB-C. Functionality wise this thing does the job - you get power, HDMI and a USB port, but in terms of design it is garbage. If you have power, USB and HDMI plugged in you have a lot of wires sticking out from this thing, and most HDMI cables are decently hefty so you have a bit of weight on the adapter. So you don't want it to be hanging off the edge of the table.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that they have the 3 inch wire coming out of this thing, but it serves zero purpose. making the adapter flush to the laptop would have saved space and made it way more practical because you don't have to have an extra six inches of space on your desk for the cables to hang off. Also I should mention the adapter has no &#34;feet&#34;, so essentially the port is the only thing taking all the stress of the cable weight. Just terrible design all around, but unfortunately it is the most reliable adapter available right now.",0.9199999999999999,,0.08945578231292517,,iPad

"By no means am I a newbie.  I had 20 years of tech experience before getting my first PC, which was a Commodore 64 and I spend a good part of my work week writing and working with software to download hospital data (although I'm not a programmer). I own something like 6 tablets, the rest being Android, and I'm typing this on an Asus Chromebox hardware hacked to run Linux Mint 18.2. Regarding PC's, as the saying goes, ""I don't BUY computers, I BUILD computers.""<br /><br />My favorite tablet is a Dragon Touch E97, which LOOKS LIKE an iPad, including the 4:3 aspect ratio but runs Android (and is no longer in production). THE reason I bought an iPad is that I mainly use tablets for viewing photos or reading, and the 16:10 aspect ratio of ALL current Android tablets is just a pain. Sooner or later the E97 battery will wear out and I'll have to junk that (like the previous one).<br /><br />I find the huge number of different swipes extremely annoying and confusing--I'm constantly either accidentally activating something or I can't figure out how to do simple things.<br /><br />I also find it annoying that the on-off switch is on the left-hand side (in landscape mode). On the E97 Dragon Touch moved it to the top, next to the volume control.  DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A BIG DEAL -- but years ago a major tech blogger pointed out that AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE tablets should be run on EXTERNAL power, NOT the battery. ALL rechargeable batteries have a LIMITED NUMBER OF RECHARGE CYCLES.  Running a tablet USUALLY on external power can ADD 18-24 MONTHS to its life.<br /><br />What does that have to do with the power switch? When I'm viewing photos, often in bed, I hold the tablet in PORTRAIT mode--with the POWER CONNECTOR at the TOP (right side in landscape). Which means the ON-OFF SWITCH is at THE BOTTOM (left side). Move the tablet just a LITTLE BIT wrong and it shuts off.",0.96,,0.053306878306878296,,iPad

"This is the only case that keeps the Ipad, well....an Ipad.<br /><br />All others cases add bulk to a device whose strongest suit is its portability.

"My case was purchased at the Apple store and was still junk, this product is no good.<br /><br />I am very disappointed with Apples design of this product. I expect more from them. I should have listened when the apple store employee told me these cases suck. However, I didn't and purchased one anyway because I liked the way they looked, the flap on the top and how they turn into a stand. I figured since it had an apple on the side it would be ok. I was wrong.<br /><br />The case is really flimsy. It is constructed of a paper like material with a felt spray on the inside and is not even 1mm thick. There are no metal or rubber structures for protection on this case so do not drop it, have something slide into it or have any accidents. This case will only protect the iPad from possible scratches due to sitting it on stuff. there is a metal strip under the paper around the top that allows for the magnet cover to be held down. Do not confuse this for any ability to protect.<br /><br />I bought this case and 1 day later my brand new pad dropped from about 2 feet while clasped in my hand. It was left with a dent on the corner of the metal. The 2 feet fall actually tore a hole in the side of the case!<br /><br />You have an expensive investment, do not take a chance with this case you will regret it. Please take my advice.

"It's a great workout headphone, but definitely not worth the price at $200. However, I got this at $170 and at that price, you could make a case especially against the Jaybirds.<br /><br />The fit is fantastic and comfortable. It does come with four total tips to adjust the fit into your ears. The problem is the sound of the headphones, or rather the transfer of soud between ear and headphone. The classic &#34;Beats&#34; sound is there, but it loses its luster because of the way it sits in your ear. The headphones don't create that seal that other earbuds do. They sort of hover or just sit loosely in your ear canal. Beats by Dre has said this allows for the wearer to hear their surroundings. With that said, they are able to get loud enough for you to listen to, but that trademark bass gets lost. It's there, it just doesn't make that punch you normally get from Beats unless pressed against the ear.<br /><br />The Bluetooth connectivity is great and connects without a problem. A huge issue that others have had is the lag when watching videos on iOS devices. When connected to my iPad or iPod, videos have a 1-2 sec delay. When connected to any of my Android devices, however, no video lag at all. There seems to be an issue with compatibility which is surprising since the Beats brand is now under the Apple umbrella. You can't ding the headphones for this issue as it works flawlessly on Android devices. I don't know if this is fixable, but this lag could be a make or break deal for those who buy Apple devices exclusively.<br /><br />These headphones are great for working out or walking around the house listening to a podcast or audiobook, but somewhere like an airplane where there's a lot of ambient noise and video watching and you might want to bring a different pair headphones. The fit issues I had might be different for some, but the delay for iOS devices can't be ignored.

"This is a good one-piece case that does a very good job protecting both the front and back of the iPad and it is aesthetically pleasing like all other Apple products. It also does a good job of keeping dust and other particulates from getting to the back surface of the iPad. So far it could be a five star product.<br /><br />However, I have two complaints worth one rating star apiece...<br /><br />Due to the flimsiness of the back side protection part of the case, two problems are introduced: the iPad fits inside of the case too loosely causing problems with the use of the headphone jack on top and with connections to the dock/cable connector on the bottom. Those two problems make plugging the iPad in to charge it, manage media on it or back it up a challenge when the iPad is left in the case as the opening for the connector does not line up very well with the connector (I do not sync nor back up my iPad using WiFi) - I usually have to move the case around to get a solid connection. Additionally, unless you are using the Apple ear buds, a secure connection for your headphones is not guaranteed because the case gets in the way of the headphone jack at the bottom of the opening for it. I use Bose QC15 headphones and their connection in the headphone jack is not complete. The audio quality and using the mic on my headphone cord with such an incomplete connection are still fine.<br /><br />Regardless of the fact that I can manipulate the case to get the power/data cable connection to work, and the headphone connection works while not being complete, Apple should have made the back cover of the case more rigid so as to make sure that the openings for the connector and headphone jack are always properly aligned and so that more than just the Apple ear buds can connect completely to the headphone jack.<br /><br />In the end, I ended up giving this case to my dad as a random gift and went with a Moshi versacover for iPad (clear, hard back case with attached ""origami"" style multi-angle Smart Cover) with a *perfect* fit, and the Moshi iVisor XT (washable, reusable always and absolutely bubble-free screen protector).<br /><br />*** First Update ***<br /><br />For those who may like to know, this review was written regarding the fit and finish of the Apple Smart Case for my third-generation iPad with the Retina display (aka iPad 3) - apologies for leaving iPad model details out of my review.

"I got these because they were on sale for $179 and I have to dictate into an iPad, so having compatible earbuds will make things easier. I ordered the Bose QC Earbuds on the same day, so comparison is pretty easy.<br /><br />Sound quality: sorry Apple fanboys, but the quality on the Airpod Pros is a joke. Bass is trash. Overall quality is unimpressive. Bose QC Earbuds (well, *any* Bose headphones, really) blow these out of the water<br /><br />Noise-cancellation: I would describe the Airpod Pros more as ""noise-dampening"" than ""noise-cancelling."" Again, Bose is far superior, though this is pretty universally known already<br /><br />Battery life: have not had long enough to say<br /><br />Long story short, the Airpod Pros are fine for conversations, dictations, and the like, and the noise-dampening is ok, but I would not recommend them for any music listening",0.96,,0.13854166666666667,,iPad
First let me say the way the shipped my product I live in an apartment where you need a key code. I gave the special instruction and the drivers don‚Äôt give a damn they‚Äôd leave your package outside the apartment where anyone walking on the side wall can pick up and go. The service maintain everything man brought this product to me. Thank god for small blessing and naturally I chewed them out. I had a pencil to go with it and that product got lost in transaction and they couldn‚Äôt tell me where it had been dropped off. So amazon drivers are incompetent I‚Äôd rather have Usps or ups drop my stuff off than amazon.<br /><br />Second I love the iPad but after having used it for two and a half weeks it went blank. Like the screen just went black when I was using procreate so I took it to the Apple store since I couldn‚Äôt force it to restart. They couldn‚Äôt fix it either so I got a replacement thanks to warranty and Apple care. So despite the fact that this was a brand new item it clocked out before a month had even gone by. My new iPad is working wonderfully and I have no issue with it what so ever. It must have be a manufacture thing who knows.,0.96,,0.11768127705627705,,iPad

"I purchased a Mac Mini to serve as a home computer. I like Apple products and for compatibility with my MBP, iPhone, iPad, and wife's iPod Touch, I felt a Mac Mini would suit the rest well.<br /><br />Overall happy with it. One major oversight was the default 2GB of RAM. Multitasking is a pain, even with simply surfing the web and playing music. With Firefox and iTunes open, a majority of the RAM is immediately used up, causing the Mini to run sluggishly.<br /><br />I ordered 8GB of RAM, which should arrive tomorrow and that will fix how slowly the Mini runs. I recommend a MINIMUM of 4GB of RAM. 2GB is way too little. Do not waste your money upgrading to 4GB from Apple! It's at least 50% cheaper to buy and install the RAM yourself. I got 8GB for $47 at TigerDirect.com. And remember to buy 8GB SODIMM DDR3 1333MHz RAM.",0.8400000000000001,,0.025,,iPad

"Battery on the two Apple Ipod Touch 4g 64gb(s) that I have used have been horrendous. I say two because the first unit I was sold at the Apple Store in downtown Philadelphia was replaced by another unit- that had exactly the same battery issues. Battery issues are these. The first day you have the Ipod Touch 4g 64gb it seemed fine. But I bought it while I was at work (on a break) and got it turned on there at the Apple Store. So it just gets turned on and ends up in my pocket as i go back to work. Next day- it has my apps on it and songs and a few videos and ebooks. But it doesn't hold the all night charge all day. Just a few hours and by day two- it has me stressing that it is going to have power at the end of my day. I don't mean from a day of use either- I mean a day in my pocket. I'm a security guard- so the Ipod Touch 4g 64 is OFF- while in my pocket all day. The only time I take it out of my pocket (and ON)is during the two breaks that I have during the day and my lunch. So during my workday- I get almost exactly 1 hours actual use from my brand new Apple Ipod Touch 4g 64gb- where it is actually ON- and the rest of my day it is OFF in my pocket! But at the end of my day- it won't even turn on because it is out of POWER.<br />You shouldn't have to pay the $430.00 cash that I paid to be stressed out worrying if your BRAND NEW IPOD TOUCH 4g 64gb is going to work.<br />I have an appointment with the Apple Store this coming Tuesday- they will blah blah blah me- and try and foist a third IPOD TOUCH 4G 64gb on me I bet- but I'm getting my money back.<br />It is a shame, though. It is truly amazing when it works- the most advanced and wonderful piece of electronics that I have ever owned- but I didn't ask to be a beta tester. When I paid my $430.00 dollars I thought they should have worked out the kinks- and expected just the awesome- Apple robbed me of my wonderful first APPLE Purchase. And have left me leery of buying any of their products ever again.<br />My Apple Ipod Touch 4g 64gb - the one I originally bought and the replacement for it-both sucked battery-wise).<br />Wait to buy this product- it's not ready for primetime.<br />I purchased the iPod Touch 4g 64gb for 399.00 plus 31.92 tax total of 430.92<br />Your telling me that the normal way of charging the thing isnt- the USB that Apple GAVE ME? (that charges 100%)<br />but that I should purchase ""some other gadget"" for more money? when the way apple sold it to me doesn't work?<br /><br />UMMM No!<br /><br />I'm a (or I was) first time Apple product user with this product.<br />Did I mention it was a replacement cuz the first one was a mess, too?<br />I need to be the one??? to figure out how to keep their brand new gadget running? Me the one to jump thru hoops and such? Do this try that blah blah blah??<br />No- my friend.<br />I'm Not the 430 dollar ""paying"" beta tester.<br />I returned the replacement- and got a chit for 430 dollars and their solemn promise to send me a check at some time in the future.<br />Bear in mind I paid them cash money- greenbacks/ USA currency.<br />I didn't want a check- I wanted what I GAVE THEM CASH!!!!!<br />It's 4 days later i have no iPod touch 4g 64gb and no money either.<br />Who knew they were such a scumbag company.<br />I'll ""probably"" get my money back soon?

"Thanks to the great people at my local Apple store I'm on my second Apple iPad case.  After less than 2 months of use, the outside layer began to peel away from the case giving the case the appearance it was shedding its skin.

The folks at my local store sugggested it could be ""environmental conditions"" (not sure what that means) but they gladly exchanged it for a new one.  Will keep an eye open and update this post as it could have simply been a fluke.<br /><br />As for general use - if you travel or use the case in landscape mode, it's great to be able to prop at a slight angle.

"I am not an Apple enthusiast.  I don't own an iPhone or iPad much less a Mac-anything but I am on my third Nano (first one died after 2 years and inadvertently washed another).  I tend to be attracted to something because it's suitable for it's intended application.  The idea behind this product is ideal for anyone who exercises on a regular basis.  The ability to download so many songs onto a device which clips to your clothing and doesn't require a holder or strap is great. Unfortunately the Shuffle does not stand up to sweat or use in humid conditions.  I had a 2nd, 3rd, and now a 4th generation shuffle and they have all died from exposure to sweat.  I used the DLO action jacket on the previous version and even had a rubber sleeve for the most recent edition and the moisture still gets to it. I really enjoyed this thing and in most regards it's the perfect running companion but I bought it in August of 2012 and it gave out during a run today, November 19, 2013 (of course it is no longer in warranty). I usually run with it once or twice a week.  The symptoms came on suddenly and without warning.  Songs would start/stop, volume would rise and fall dramatically, then the device shut down.  I connected it to my computer and plugged it directly into a wall with no reaction.  Put it in rice and thus far, still nothing.I have tried the Sony W series all in one headphone/mp3 player promoted by Meb Keflezighi but it doesn't stay in my ears. I hesitate to give it less than 3 stars because outside of the lack of sweat resistance it is almost perfect but I can't give it a 2.5 so 2 stars it is. Due to the fact that there is no other device that fits my preferences for exercising, I will probably buy the next generation shuffle and see if there is an affordable protective case for it. The design needs more attention to detail but due to innovative form factor, Apple will more than likely get some more of my money.",0.86,,0.20018768768768766,,iPad

"I purchased this as an upgrade from the iPad pro 1st gen (2017).  I had been using my old one mainly for portable tv/stream viewing, and some digital design.  It was working fine, even after three years.  I was super surprised upon receiving this new iPad that it is lighter, slimmer, and sleeker.  Of course, the camera is better, although I don't take a lot of photos with it.  It runs iOS 13.4 seamlessly, and is able to handle the two programs I use the most, procreate and goodnotes, effectively.  I love that it's not such a huge beast (even though the screen size is the same) and that the third party case options are also sleeker and lighter.  The main reason I upgraded was to be able to use the Apple Pencil 2.  It's got a much better design, and charges simply by snapping onto the magnet on the side of the iPad.  The pencil is also weighted differently than the first one, and doesn't have that weird one-sidedness or heaviness in the hand.  I can work in my apps for a longer period of time due to the 4th gen supporting the 2nd gen pencil.  The only cons - there is a new connector.  There is no lightning port.  The charger is now a USB C, and if you're using a PC to back up your iPad (which I am), it needs to be new enough that it has a USB C port on it (thankfully, I just got a new HP not too long ago, so it DOES have one).  Otherwise, you'll need to buy an adapter.  And you can't use your old chargers with it.  I would also recommend getting a compatible 30w charger for faster charging.  It comes with an 18w.",0.96,,0.15452317290552586,,iPad

I love this smart cover.  I had not thought of one thing though.  I had a concern with the vinyl smart covers.  I have seen them crack along a seam and did not want that.

To keep the side that touches the screen clean I always fold the cover in half so that the screen does not get dirty. Other than that minor issue the cover is great.

"Our Mac Mini was still rocking along, but we'd reached the limit of it's OS upgrades, so we had to get a new one in order to use our tax software. Backed up to an external drive so the migration was pretty seamless. Only lost a few apps that were so old we had stopped using them anyway. Some frustration in setting up was that in order to use the computer with all the necessary USB accessories we had a new USB 3.0 hub. When in use the hub interfered with WiFi so that the Internet was unavailable. So either you could use the computer with no USB attachments or you couldn't use the Internet. Turns out the solution was counterintuitive. You have to slide the connector for the hub into the USB slot only far enough so that you get connectivity. If you push it all the way in there is some sort of electrical weirdness that sets up interference with both Bluetooth and wireless. Wasted about six hours on this problem. Seems to be a Mac/USB 3.0 issue, but rare enough that it is buried in comments like this and not generally known on the Apple site.",0.9,,0.04360795454545454,,iPad

That's twice as bad as my dad's flip phone from 7 years ago!!! Not only did they add this deplorable excuse for a camera, they also fudged a lot of the new features.

"I wanted to love these but due to poor call quality I think I'm going back to the Airpods 2nd gen.<br /><br />Positives<br />-Music audio quality is slightly improved especially with active noise cancellation enabled<br />-Chip switches more quickly between devices<br />-Active Noise Cancellation is cool<br />-They don't fall out of your ears - better for the gym<br />-People will think you are cool for having the latest Airpods<br />- 3 sets of tips<br /><br />Negatives<br />-Poor call quality - nearly everyone I talked to on the phone complained about the call quality - said I sounded far away etc.<br />-Case bulkier - can't open and close with one hand easily<br />-More expensive<br />-Apple including a USB C to Lightning cable but no brick...rendering this cable worthless to me (If you have a 2018-2019 iPad Pro or 2016 or newer MacBook great) but cmon Apple... everyone else puts a charging brick in the box.<br /><br />Summary<br />-I saw a lot of reviews on these and had high expectations. However after a few days of use I'm very disappointed. As a musician who plays 7 instrument and has a home recording studio I can tell you mic angle/direction and proximity is huge for audio quality. In Airpods Gen 1 & 2 the mic in the stem angles the mic towards your mouth resulting in excellent phone call audio. The ""Pro"" version places the mic on the side angling away from your mouth loses this.<br /><br />Essentially Apple has traded voice call quality for Noise Cancellation....a good marketing ploy but bad decision for many users.<br /><br />If you are using these primarily for music you are good but for phone calls especially outside or in noisy settings these fail. Do not buy you will regret it. Stick to Airpods Gen 1 or 2<br /><br />Also this product on Amazon fixed my main issue on the previous Gen Airpods allowing me to use them at the gym.<br /><br />AhaStyle 4 Pairs Earbuds Cover Anti-Slip Ear Tips Silicone Compatible with Apple AirPods 2 & 1 or EarPods-„ÄêNot Fit in The Charging Case„Äë (2 Pair Large & 2 Pairs Small, White) https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07V6HPRZF/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_3LscEb89YE992<br /><br />Anyone else having these same issues?",0.96,,0.08519047619047619,,iPad

"For the first few years that tablets were available, I thought they were practically useless. I used a Kindle Fire for a few months because I got it at a steep discount but never found myself motivated to use it. Then I got an iPad Air for my wife for Christmas. Once I saw how easy the Retina display was to read, I ordered one for myself and now I'm hooked. Whether I'm reading the New York Times, a blog post, or an ebook, I'm enjoying myself.<br />It's also a very handy work computer with the Pages word processing app, although I still can't use the display-based keyboard very well. I'm old school enough to need the physical feel of keys.<br />The iPad is pricey compared to some of the Windows tablets, but I personally think iOS is a better operating system than Windows.<br />One complaint is that the email client that comes with iOS does NOT grab email as smoothly as my iPhone. Opening the email app on the iPad always shows me mail from several days ago; on the iPhone, I always see the very latest email on top.

"This is a very nice, quality case that I feel will last longer than the iPad inside it, but it lacks in a couple key areas. With the flap in the slot you can either lay it down where it sits at about a 30 degree angle, or set it on the rather small edge where it's almost completely vertical. The latter is not vet very stable and, while I know not designed for fit, nearly impossible to use any touch functions.<br /><br />Some sort of closing mechanism like a latch or button would also have been nice. The edges are also extremely uncomfortable when you're using the iPad against your body. I see no logical reason for them to be there. I imagine the thinking was that if dropped, the hard edges may offer some protection, but as heavy as the iPad is, I doubt it.<br /><br />Other than those problems, this is one of the best cases available.

"I haven‚Äôt owned an iPad since the first one came out. Back then the pencil didn‚Äôt exist and you used a pen with a rubber tip.<br /><br />I ordered this and the 2nd gen pencil with the intention of getting back into doodling and writing- it has become so much more. I find myself using my phone less and less. While I haven‚Äôt been able to use my PC due to renovating I don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôd use it in place of this. I‚Äôve made worksheets for my kids, recipe cards, journals, edited photos- what used to take me close to an hour takes virtually nothing using my iPad.<br /><br />If you‚Äôre thinking of buying one- do it. You won‚Äôt regret it. I searched high and low for something portable and settled on this..and I‚Äôm so glad I did!<br /><br />***My only complaint is the shipping was bad on Amazon‚Äôs part as they gave me faulty tracking numbers and said it had been shipped before it was. My iPad also did not come with a charging brick like it‚Äôs supposed to. Luckily I own the iPhone Max and it‚Äôs compatible with the iPad cable so I didn‚Äôt have to go through the hassle of contacting customer service.

"Best note-taking device.<br />USB-c everything, please. It makes file management much easier.<br /><br />Good for light digital graphics design, video production, or docs related works on the go.<br />Not really for CAD production, but there are several good apps for just demonstration and presentation.<br />For other professions or power users, multitasking is still not as efficient as Macbook or Windows laptops.<br /><br />The display is one of the most color-accurate under 13in size. It has 120hz refresh rate, which is even better.<br />A minor downside of the display is the input lag, not a significant factor for the most use cases. If you play rhythm games a lot you would find it affect your input accuracy. I think the 240hz sampling rate only helps the sensibility of the input. I feel the lag is definitely there, please prove me wrong if you have the equipment to test this.<br /><br />The device I think is not as highly overpriced as other Apple products, the performance can justify its price tag.<br />I would recommend this and the last-gen iPad pro to any students, artists, and field workers.

"Amazing speedy and responsive tablet as expected when buying an iPad Pro. The tablets speakers and big screen are amazing for any type of media consumption as well as multi tasking. The iPad Pro definitely is a tablet worthy of even replacing your laptop in some circumstances.<br /><br />However the problem I had was with Amazon. I bough the Tablet directly from Amazon and received it a week later. The iPad was shipped in its Apple Box inside a an Amazon box. However the Apple Box wasn't sealed. When taking off the top cover of the box the iPad usually has a protective plastic cover around it; it was also missing. Upon inspecting the actual tablet no dents or anything but there was some dirt on the back of the iPad. After I cleaned it with a micro fiber cloth the iPad looked better. However I am disappointed that iPad for a brand new iPad and got a used one and if I wanted to get a replacement I'd have too send this one back, that I have already set up, and await another one from Amazon.<br /><br />In conclusion be aware that even though it's a great tablet from Apple, Amazon might try to screw you over by sending you a used unit after you pay for a new one.

"I currently have an I pod touch 3rd generation player that I have enjoyed for a couple of years.  I use it to play music, watch movies, store pictures to show friends and several I tunes apps to play games or get information. This Christmas while visiting family and friends one of our nephews happened to have the 4th generation I pod touch. We compared the overall features and I liked the two camera addition along with the voice recording. He was able to use his wireless feature to connect to his fathers cell phone and make internet calls.  So after the holidays I went on line to check for a used or a refurbished 4th generation I pod. I have bought other products the same way and have been satisfied with pass results. Products that are refurbished generally carry some type of warranty that is close to a new product warranty and save you quit a bit of money.  This helps when you buy products that have fixed pricing from the manufacturer like Apple or Microsoft. I do the same type of shopping when going to Best-Buy, Target, Walmart etc. I look for something I want and then ask if they have an open box, display or clearance one available. This also works for me shopping on-line.  I have bought many things through Amazon checking for both new and used.<br /><br />Back to to the I pod touch 4th generation.  The latest I pod touch has been a real pleasure.  I like the the two camera features.  It allows me to carry my music, photos, videos and gaming entertainment as well as take pictures and movies on the go.  In the pass I might forget to take my camera but have my I pod touch player or to take my camera and forget my I pod touch player; now I have both. I guess I could have gotten a I phone but I didn't want to to pay a monthly feed that can get pretty expensive. Now that I have the 4th generation I pod the other differences are the screen resolution which is better one the new model. The speaker sound is also better and the size is thinner. The new I pod also has a larger memory to allow for more apps, music, video and pictures. I'm still learning some of the things it can do.  I haven't tried to hook up to person's cell phone or try to make a internet call. There were only few negative things I can think of. I wish the still picture was a higher quality; 2 mega pixel or 4 mega pixel would be just fine. The video camera quality was good and can be zoomed in on in play back mode. I would have like to see an app from I tunes that allowed you to make internet calls in a Wi-Fi area. Overall I'm very happy with my purchase.",0.9,,0.1964646464646465,,iPad

"Purchased Apple iPad 11 Pro as a replacement for my iPad 2. Learned after receiving the product that it uses the newer USB-C  cable for attaching to other hardware. My existing Desktop and Laptop PCs and (most importantly) iPad 2 all use the standard USB 3.0 cable.

"......Four stars.<br /><br />And it would have been decidedly less if the device got damaged in shipping.<br /><br />I've had the iPod touch now for 34 months, a superb item. Finally, after this particular iPod is no longer sold I've found the time to write a review that can only cite the packing manner from Amazon for the piece.<br /><br />The iPod itself was in its plastic case the size of a deck of cards......freely rattling around in a box half the size of a phone book! No inner packing to suspend the iPod in its shipping box, just free to bound around in there. NOT ACCEPTABLE for a device that cost $365 with a life intended to manage electrons.<br /><br />So this initial experience cited at this late date will suggest that the iPod touch 4th generation is one tough cookie. It's been flawless for me......but I never cared much for iTunes as a program to manage the iPod. I'm probably in a minority there but I think the navigating is ponderous and confusing.<br /><br />Lastly since early on, I used an Incipio Hive dermaSHOT Shock-Absorbing Silicone Case with bulging corners to protect the iPod, a fine product.",0.9,,0.14796296296296296,,iPad

"I bought this item after selling my iPhone to buy a secondhand iPad and needed a small, affordable music player for on the go.<br /><br />My unit arrived with a loose play button and the back metal plate was popping up in the corner.  Needless to say, I contact Amazon and they were AMAZING with my request for an exchange, like always.  This is why I return to shop at Amazon.  No hassle.... quick, prepaid return label... overnight Saturday shipping of the replacement iPod.  The representative apologized and was knowledgable.m Can't ask for more.<br /><br />On the other hand, I have always been lukewarm on Apple's quality control.  The second unit actually arrived with a crooked clickwheel, but I will not bother with an exchange because it is such a minor issue.  Apple quality is hit or miss- at least for me.  I've had probably 50 Apple products over the years and I usually wind up having some quality control problem on my first purchase about 75% of the time.  Perhaps I am simply unlucky!  Bottom line- just check your items for any issues when they arrive and don't hesitate to contact Amazon if anything is wrong.  You don't have to be afraid that you will have to justify your exchange, get a rep that doesn't understand you, or spend all day on the phone (you can speak with an Amazon associate any time of the day or night through online chat).<br /><br />Anyway, once I manage to get an Apple product without manufacturing flaws, they are rivaled by no other.  This is simply the best  super small player you will find.  The simplicity is what draws me.  The iPod shuffle has one purpose- music.  Absolutely no other features - no extraneous watch faces, internet browsers, photos app.... just music.  You've got voiceover, which is a must have for a displayless iPod.  The buttons are easy to remember for play, pause, ff, rewind.... but if anyone is used to using a 6th gen iPod nano,mthey may mistake the shuffle switch and voiceover buttons on top for volume buttons out of habit.  Sound quality is absolutely astounding for a player this small!  It is not tinny at all.  Two things to note- I do wish the capacity was a bit larger than 2 GB, but not a huge deal.  Also, it can get frustrating trying to open the clip.  The clip's hinge is pretty strong and the device is a bit slippery... not to mention that it is almost impossible to open the clio without pressing the rewind or play pause button. I also wish the hinge of the clip was on the right side of the device rather than the left as I am right handed and instinctively go to press the wrong side every time I try to open the clip.<br /><br />One hint for those who may not know- you can ""lock"" the buttons so that you don't accidently press them while working out or what have you.  To do this, all you have to do is press and hold the play pause button until you hear a lock sound through the headphones (while the device is on of course).  Your controls will now be locked until you repeat the process and hear the unlocking sound to unlock them.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this device for its convenient size, simplicty and amazing sound, barring a few minor annoyances with the clip and hit or miss assembly quality.",0.86,,0.04691167675861554,,iPad

"I'm a long time iPad user. I've had the original iPad, the iPad Mini, the iPad Air and now the iPad Pro (13&#34;). In the past I've tried the Apple Smart Cover and didn't care for it. I felt the magnet holding the cover closed on the screen was too weak, causing the cover to shift and slip a lot when I moved. I did however like Apple's leather iPad Air Smart Case, having the backing kept everything more in place when the iPad was transported.<br /><br />When I purchased my iPad Pro, I looked at the case options on the market as adding a Keyboard really makes this a workhorse machine. The iPad Smart Keyboard was the first I looked at in the store, and based on my experience with the Smart Cover in the past I discounted it almost immediately in favor of the Logitech Create keyboard case.<br /><br />The Logitech Create case was a horrible investment. At first it seemed nice, the Smart Connector compatibility meant no charging, it protected the entire iPad, the keyboard was backlit, it had function keys which the Apple Smart Keyboard did not, and the magnetic connection between the case and the Smart Connector on the iPad was extremely strong. But after a short period of use, I discovered that the Create was scuffing the screen of my iPad. (NOTE: This apparently is a known issue, as Apple has since replaced my iPad as a result...yet they continue to sell the case in their stores). Additionally, the Logitech Create frequently exhibited lag when typing and many times keystrokes were missed, or the last letter typed kept repeating itself as if the key was stuck.<br /><br />I then tried the Zagg keyboard case, which is a Bluetooth case with a hinge. This design choice allows MUCH easier &#34;transformability&#34; from computer form factor to Tablet, to Lenovo Yoga-style hybrid. While I had no functionality issues with the Zagg case, the weight and bulk added to the iPad were troublesome.  So I finally broke down and invested in the Apple Keyboard case.<br /><br />I should have saved myself a ton of time and just purchased this in the beginning. I'm not sure if it's because the Keyboard adds enough bulk to the cover, but the magnet holding the cover to the screen is MUCH stronger than the Smart Cover of the past. It's not like it's glued shut, but it's enough to keep the cover in place during transit. This cover enables the back of my iPad to be displayed (and I can use Superhero stickers for those like me who had a Macbook and personalized it) and the design of the iPad shows through. The keyboard is comfortable to type on, and unlike the Logitech Create there is NO lag and no missed keystrokes.<br /><br />The only area of improvement (thus a 4 star rating) is the lack of backlighting and function keys. Having used all three major keyboard case options for the 12.9&#34; iPad Pro, I'd highly recommend this case to anyone.",0.78,,0.08487055933484505,,iPad

"I was looking for an anti-glare screen protector for iPad Pro 12.9, and while there were cheaper options, some people would complain about &#34;pixel-y&#34; look on those products. So I decided to bite the bullet and order Power Support Anti-Glare film set based on their reviews and recommendations I found online.<br /><br />Boy this is one of the best iOS accessories I have ever invested in.<br /><br />Extremely high quality product. The film's anti-glare technology diffuses the light glares into fine grains, so fine that you can barely see &#34;pixels&#34; of glaring light being diffused. I first thought the texture would be paper-like, and it might ruin my Apple Pencil nib, but no, the texture is smooth as butter and I just love touching and writing on it. The installation is super easy because the film is flexible and paper-thin and it's truly reusable, which means you can peel on-and-off as many times as you like to, say, stick away some dusts you didn't catch during installation.<br /><br />At the heart of the product is the resulting display after installing the film set. Minimal noticeable differences in visual quality, colors, or brightness after applying the film. That means you can still see vibrant photos and sharp texts while you read and crisp lines while you draw. When reading directly against a backlight, instead of getting annoying glares, you get pleasant grains of diffused light that becomes so subtle it barely affects your iPad experience.<br /><br />Definitely becoming a fan.

"I bought this to add additional ports to a Mac Mini with M1 chip.  Not sure why Apple thinks they don't need to include SD card readers on the Mini.  They are still needed! SD card readers work as expected on the 8 in 1 device. Transferring 3 files totaling about 560MB only took a few seconds.  So this seems to be a speedy device in that regard.  Build quality is very solid with the aluminum enclosure.  I also like that the SD slots are on the end instead of a cable connection port.  The cable to connect to the computer could be a touch longer.  But, considering this is geared more towards laptop use, I can't fault it too much, since I'm using it on a desktop machine. I wish it had rubber, foam, or felt feet to help keep it from sliding around and making metal to metal contact on top of the Mac Mini.  At least I can add those easily enough myself.<br /><br />I plugged in my Android phone and iPad pro to this 8 in 1 device.  The Android phone indicates charging. iPad indicates it is not charging. Upon further inspection in System Report, it appears that the iPad and Android devices are connected to the USB 2.0 channel and are only receiving 500 mA of power. So they will likely charge if not using them, albeit slowly.  I did not buy this with the intention of charging my devices, so I'm not overly concerned. But if someone else has a need for this then beware this limitation.  I also tried this on a Windows Laptop. I observed the iPad charging when I first plugged it in.  After plugging in my Android phone to charge, the iPad began to indicate not charging.  I tried plugging back into the Mini.  When the iPad is plugged in alone, it indicates charging.  Upon connecting additional devices, the iPad would cease to charge.  So I believe the issue is not OS dependent, rather an issue with how the power is distributed within this device. Data transfer speeds can still potentially be an issue if I were to try and Sync data with my Android phone and iPad since they are only connecting to USB 2.0. I don‚Äôt intend to use this device for these purposes.  So while this may be a fault to some, I am not overly concerned.<br /><br />I am now able to relocate a WD 2TB external drive to this hub and it connects to the USB 3.0 bus and functions as expected.  So I can simply plug in the phone of iPad to the, newly freed-up, standard USB A port on the Mini.  It is odd that the iPad will connect to the USB 3.0 bus when connected directly to the mini.  I'm uncertain if this is a limitation imposed by the 8 in 1 device or Apple's response to it.<br /><br />HDMI works ok. Although at 30Hz refresh rate as opposed to using the built-in HDMI port on the Mini at 60Hz, I'd rarely be inclined to use it unless I was not using a 4k monitor.  Also, charging the android phone with a USB C to USC C cable seemed to work, but I could not see the device in system report, so this confirms that is not a data port, just power only.  Which seems to be indicated in the product description on Amazon.  So no surprises there.  Overall, this will suit my needs at a fantastic price.",0.8800000000000001,,0.061522482893450636,,iPad

"Simply can't understand the negative reviews for this case. It is light as a feather, fits very well (have had it on for well over a month and it has never come loose). I agree this case could be a little cheaper but honestly after spending so much on my iPad I really didn't mind forking out some extra cash for a cover that i'm happy with.<br /><br />Here's why it deserves 5 stars:<br /><br />*Extremely light - Adds virtually nothing to the iPad (i've tried the Speck Pixel Skin HD which is similar and it is really heavy). I read a lot on my iPad so I really find weight to be an important factor.<br /><br />*Good looking - Nice colors available and the back and front both look really cool.<br /><br />*Easy to clean - i've spilled on the case, held it with oily hands, and so forth and always has been extremely easy to just wipe it clean with a damp cloth.<br /><br />*Feels good in the hand. I like the texture, its nice and grippy without feeling tacky.<br /><br />*Durable - I am a heavy user and very few of my accessories look like brand new a month after I've had them, this case does.",0.9,,0.2135216866466867,,iPad
"Yeah, it's old.  But I still consider this a better Express than the current version, if only for the handiness of this thing.  The current gen Express has a desk footprint, not unlike an AppleTV.  This one just plugs right into the wall, which is very convenient for my purposes.<br /><br />So while it's true that you don't get any of the whiz-bang tech you see in current routers (dual band, etc), my need for a dead simple travel router to support my iPad/Mac makes this a good solution.  No power cord, so packing it is pretty easy.<br /><br />So to be clear, this isn't an enterprise-level router.  It's a quick, simple, convenient way to get connectivity.",0.82,,0.1636904761904762,,iPad

"I used this case for about two months before ultimately ditching it for a much nicer leather case from Piel Frama. While Apple should be commended for designing a case that is quite functional and, by all appearances, extremely durable, their choice of material was not particularly well thought out. Even in an fairly clean office environment, this case is a dust magnet. During the two months I used it, I was constantly brushing off dust smudges and wiping it down. After awhile, it became so annoying that I simply decided to buy another case.",0.86,,-0.06635802469135803,,iPad

Plan on going in full circles if you want to talk to customer support....google the issue works better than anything apple care can help. Apparently when you buy these and wear them, according to apple, you must lay still in bed, not move your head, and not touch the headphones at all in order for them to work great.  If you sweat in them, (ironic for workout headphones) do not plan on having the warranty upheld.

"Yes the price isn't the most affordable, but who is forcing these peoples hands to purchase a high end pair of headphones besides themselves. I use a wide variety of headphones from leisure use to studio engineering and these headphones are at the lowest a 7 on a scale from 1 to 10. For equalizers on most devices you  simply need to set your levels to flat because these carry a very balanced sound with portable devices i.e. iPhones, iPods, iPads. On my MacBook the eq sucked but that's obviously the MacBooks equalizer if I get a completely different sound from my portable devices. The warranty is great, durability is solid, stylish maybe I guess, and sound quality is above average. I think Bose has more of an acoustic sound compared to these. And they are overdriven like the Beats by Dre Studios (first generation atleast). My opinion is ppl will side with what they prefer and some dislike this brand just as some dislike Apple over PC and vice versa. So go for what you like, but these are below average or basic sounding. People just need to learn how to use third EQ.",0.78,,0.19934782608695653,,iPad

"I am super disappointed with the fragility of the device and the numerous irritations with trying to get it serviced when broken.  It has been a fragile device which has needed several factory resets, has locked up, and failed to restore everything back from cloud storage.  Do not get this for your kids if you're not willing to spend hours helping them debug it, or if you live outside driving range of an Apple store.<br /><br />I bought the ipod touch as a birthday gift for my daughter in early November 2012.  Eight months later, it has the White Screen of Death.  She has dropped the device before, but not within weeks of its failure.  It had a protective cover.  We ran through all the technical help, did a reset to factory conditions, and nothing worked.  Watch enough YouTube videos, and the most likely problem is a tiny ribbon cable slipped out of place from its connector internally.<br /><br />So, notice that there is a 1 year warranty on the device?  It only applies to 'manufacturing defects', which pretty much only covers you if it is DOA.  If it ran for a while and then stops working, if you EVER dropped it, you're looking at a non-warranty repair.  Even if the failure did not coincide with a drop.<br /><br />Apple does not service its own devices.  It has contracted that out to another company, and Apple forwarded us to MyTechHelp.  They'll want you to pay $50 just to LOOK at it, and you have to pay $15 shipping as well, and parts will be extra.  During the call to arrange service, they talked to my wife and daughter about our wireless network and tried very hard to sell us 'management services' for the network.  I'm pretty sure my wife tried to veto every word they said about this, and she got quite frustrated with the MyTechHelp person running through their script with the hard sell.  The order confirmation e-mail states we'll owe $15/month for this service.  We can cancel it, but you have to jump through that hurdle to cancel something we never wanted in the first place.  Would you want that hassle, especially if they give you the 'let me connect you to my manager' line when you call to cancel?<br /><br />This just reeks of Apple dodging its warranty and another company making fat profits off repairs and forcing you to pay for (then cancel) services you do not agree to.<br /><br />CORRECTION: This situation smelled a little too fishy.  Googe ""Apple Customer Service"" and the top hit is the link to MyTechHelp.com.  They are not affiliated with Apple, and it's their fault we had such a bad experience.  Apple was much better about supporting the warrantee when I talked to them directly.  I changed the rating to 3 stars because the ipod has still been a trouble prone fragile device, but so far it looks like I'm getting the warranty support I expected.",0.8800000000000001,,-0.013567493112947653,,iPad

"I used to be a follower of apple, from year to year I traded in my Ipod for the newest model because of their features which I found revolutionary like the 160gig Ipod, the touch screen, and the portable size Shuffle (which I used while working out). I thought they did it again with this years addition to the Ipod Touch which now has two cameras located one on the front and back just like the ones on the iphone 4g, which is advertised to take HD clarity pictures/video, I again traded my Ipod to buy this version. Once I got home and took some pictures I noticed there was something horribly wrong with the design of this ipod.<br /><br /> The first picture I took was extremely blurry, thinking it must be the lighting I tried it again and again both to the same outcome. The pictures all came out incredibly blurry so fuzzy in fact I could hardly tell what was in the photo. This clarity of picture had similar quality to those that were taken with the first cellphone/camera. I as an apple consumer will not accept this from a company who has revolutionized the field of hand held electronics. I feel like I have been let down and get the feeling that Apple now has less of an attitude to try to beat out the competition with unique design but are just relying on the loyalty of the customers to the apple brand. This fear that Apple no longer cares about impressing its customers inspired me to write this review and I hope that I can prevent this from happening to anybody else because I might save you money just because I opened the product to really check it out I owe apple $40.00 to return a product not worthy of the apple brand.",0.9,,0.04067460317460318,,iPad

"First, shipping IS a valid review topic on Amazon, at least right at this moment, as some people will order elsewhere or even cancel an existing order based off of shipping delays.  Having said that, I will say that Amazon did get my ipod to me within the window that they had promised, and I did not pay extra.

The retina display and the faster processor are the two biggest noticable improvements for me both of which make my ipod experience much more enjoyable.<br /><br />Overall I would echo the idea of another reviewer who said that the ipod touch is really the embodiment of the promises of the computer age, full access to music, video, ebooks, email, etc etc etc.<br /><br />The one complaint that I have is I don't like the slimmer design, the 3G touch was plenty slim for me.  Due to the curvature of the sides, the volume and sleep buttons are harder to push.  Maybe I'll get used to this and it certainly isn't a dealbreaker for me.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW REGARDING SHIPPING:<br />Order placed 1 Sept, just got shipping notice & tracking number Tuesday 21 Sept.  A longer wait than I had hoped, but considering the case I ordered should arrive about the same time I think all will work out in the end.  Very happy with Amazon's price, plus no sales tax and free 2nd day shipping with Amazon Prime.  Note that Amazon upgraded to overnight shipping at no charge to me to get it to me by the promised date.<br /><br />I know I'll be happy with this unit, I was very happy with the 3rd gen.  I don't buy the ipod for the camera (that's what cameras are for!) I'm sure next years model will be even better, and I will do the same thing next year as I did this year - sell my ""old"" ipod on ebay and buy the new model.  I got nearly $300 for my ipod 3rd gen 64GB as I take good care of my stuff, so this upgrade only cost me about $100 plus $20 for a new case.<br /><br />I hope others start to see their units arriving soon.  I'm sure next years model will be even better, but I just didn't want to wait.",0.9,,0.23284770784770786,,iPad

I was looking for a 64gb ipod for my husband because he likes to listen to a lot of live shows which take up a lot of room. Because he is a no frills guy I knew he would not even notice if it was an old version or that the back of the case had markings on it (screen is like brand new).

Had to change my review to 1 star.  After less than a month of use this dock failed and won‚Äôt work anymore.  Amazon says I am outside of a return/refund window so I guess I just lost out! I was noticing before failure the usb drive I had plugged into dock kept disappearing.  I thought I was accidentally moving it causing it to disconnect.  Nope.  As soon as I would touch the dock I could feel that it was very hot.  Unplugged from my IPad and plugged it into a powered OWC port to see if it worked better.  It did for maybe about a week then anything plugged into it would stop showing up on my ipad or Mac. Unplugged everything and tried to plug in one item and no response.  Just to piggy back on a couple of reviews that say this device fails it is 100% true.  Save your money and get a better product.

"If you have more than one Apple device I do not recommend these.  Owned these for about 5 days.  I have iPad, iPhone, and Apple Watch.

"I reserve the right to update my review.....<br /><br />First I'll start by saying that these are the best earphones I've used for working out ever....when they actually worked.  The fit is snug (regardless of ear size).  Over the course of 2 weeks, I used these earphones 2-4 hours daily.  I used them on the train, while on the eliptical (8hrs), running (20miles), and at the driving range.  When they worked, sound was great (comparable to my Bose MIE2i), build quality is great.<br /><br />One small caveat.  Music sounds great, however I tried to use them while watching netflix at the gym, and the audio seems to not be in sync and is delayed.  I personally don't think this is a Beats issue...and is more a Bluetooth downfall, but since these are the only bluetooth earphones/headphones I've had, I can not confirm that is the case.<br /><br />About 10 days after using them, I noticed that the volume down button on the inline mic stopped working.  I found this strange so I called Amazon support and called Beats support directly.  I had a lengthy conversation with Beats.  I was asked if I sweat during my workouts...which I answered yes.  I asked if that was an issue, and they proceeded to say no, and that they are sweat resistant (not sure why they asked then).  I un-paired the earphones with both my iPhone and iPad and re-paired them with my iPhone and PRESTO...the volume buttom started to work again.<br /><br />2 days later, the volume up and down stopped working.  I figured I had found the solution and just needed to re-pair them to my iphone.  I turned off the earphones, un-paired from my phone and then tried to re-pair them...but to my surprise...I was unable to turn them back on.  I've attempted to charge them, but haven't had any success getting them to turn on.<br /><br />I'm hoping I just received a bad version of these earphones as I am exchanging them and purchasing them again.  I want to like them...and I will give them the benefit of the doubt, so I plan on trying them again.<br /><br />I will update my review after I receive the new earphones.

Since my job has me flying at least 2 times a week I have searing for a great headphone to fly with. I must admit I was kinda weary about purchasing these headphones after reading the reviews. But I must say I am very glad that I got these headphones. Yes they are a bit heavy but hey they are made from metal and not cheap plastic. I was first in the airport and using them while waiting for my flight and listening to music on my iPhone 5 and a phone call came in. The noise cancellation was perfect and I could just a hear my call and nothing around. The only slight problem was that the mic was very loud as my girlfriend would describe. The inflight experience was the best I've had! The noise cancellation drowned out the jet engine noises and provided excellent sound. On the plane I watch movies from my iPad and the headphones made me feel like I was at the movies. I could hear every sound a from leaves falling to rain drops. I was very impressed and I will never fly without them! If you're a frequent flier like myself this is a must have.,0.78,,0.3191228070175439,,iPad

"Let me preface by saying that I am a loyal apple customer. I have completely bought in to the elegant, easy to use, convenient, outrageously priced, company that is Apple. I have the latest Apple Watch, MacBook Pro, iPad, Apple pencil, and iPhone. And I am here to tell you that the AirPods pro are NOT WORTH IT!<br /><br />I'll start with the good: These headphones have very good noise cancelling. It baffles me how Apple was able to produce such great noise cancelling technology in an in-ear headphone. They also have transparency mode which is almost better than not wearing any headphones at all. You can hear yourself and your surroundings clear as day and all it takes to switch between the two is holding the stem for 2 seconds. The sound quality is also great. At least, when the headphone actually stays in your ear. Theres good balance and you feel completely immersed in the music. I also like the new system for pausing/unpausing sound. It is more assuring to hear a button click than praying that you tapped in the right spot on the right bud (which is what the original AirPods required).  However despite the great engineering that went into these headphones, I do not recommend buying them!<br /><br />When I first fitted them in my ear they felt snug and the ear fitting gauge said the medium ones were perfect. Since then, I don't know if my ears have somehow stretched or what happened but the AirPods now fall out ALL THE TIME. I do wear them for long periods of time and they are usually comfortable for the first 30 minutes, but then my inner ear flaps start aching in pain. They have fallen out multiple times while I'm sitting at my desk not moving, and don't even get me started on what its like to exercise in them (lets just say as soon as there is any sweat it's game over). I know you're probably thinking ""Why don't you just put a bigger earpiece on?"" Nope. I will never do that again. If the pain from the medium earpiece is annoying, the bigger earpiece is unbearable.<br /><br />Not only are they uncomfortable, but they also die way faster than the original air-pods! This is probably due to the fact that I use them in noise canceling or transparency mode exclusively, but let me explain. I bought the AirPods Pro because I wanted portable noise-canceling headphones. If I was okay with non-noise cancelling, then I would have just stuck witch my original AirPods and saved $250+!  I can usually wear these for 3.5-4 hours before they die whereas my original AirPods would last 7 hours easily.<br /><br />While the noise canceling is amazing, my original AirPods (and even regular headphones) do fine job of blocking out external noise when the music is lout enough. i would choose comfortable headphone that get the job done over super uncomfortable ones with real noise canceling. I also think there are much more comfortable noise canceling headphones on the market such as Beats and Bose over ear headphones.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I gave my original AirPods to a friend and dislike these AirPods Pro so much that I have reverted to OG chorded apple headphones. I suffered for 4 weeks. I was in denial that this investment could be so not worth it. But I finally caved and I'm so glad thatI did because I am so much happier using my $20 headphones than the $250 AirPods Pro.<br /><br />The original AirPods are great! I used them every single day. They are convenient, comfortable, and very compatible with my other devices. Unfortunately the AirPods Pro have been a major loss for me. Yes they do have unbelievable noise cancelling and transparency technology along with a great sound, but they are UNCOMFORTABLE and do not work for my daily life. Please save $100 and get the original AirPods! I wish I had mine back!",0.96,,0.2030937385907265,,iPad

"Just keep in mind that this non-wi-fi Sony BDP-S1700 Blu-ray player can definitely access online apps like Netflix, etc. via a hard-wired Ethernet cable connection to a router. No more finnicky wi-fi connection headaches and hiccups for me, thanks to this somewhat unique ""wired"" streaming unit. Also, it does not support Amazon Prime Video. You will need that access Amazon Prime Video either via a smart TV or via an Amazon Fire TV Stick and an active Amazon Prime membership. Not big deals for me, as a Prime member. This nice Sony is an excellent unit for my primary purpose of playing my large collections of my favorite movies on Blu-ray and DVD discs and my music collection on CD discs and ""wired""  streaming on the bedroom TV. The picture and sound are beautifully rendered. It is of high quality, high value, and performing flawlessly, like all of my other newer and older Sony audio/video and home theater products that I have enjoyed over many years. In my experience, Sony definitely makes great, reliable products in many categories for many budgets. They excel in picture and sound. They are well-engineered and well-built with useful features I enjoy using. That holds true here, and I really do like this very affordable unit as well as I like my higher-end Sony ES products. When my budget permits, I hope to add the higher-end Sony UBP- X1100ES as an upgrade for playing my movie and music disc collections in my main Sony ES media setup. I then expect this one to provide me with several more years of entertainment as a backup in the bedroom. It is a great, affordable buy with great picture and sound, and nice features for many, including nice ""wired"" streaming.

It is very simple to use - I never even looked at the instructions.  It does take a fair amount of computing time to import video, maybe 30 minutes for a 30 minute dvd.

"This camera is perfect for people who record family events once or twice per year and need things to be foolproof.  This thing is wonderful for casual recording, though you'll definitely want a multi-pack of DVDs, since the limited time can make changing discs a constant event.  You can't really edit these easily, but you could probably stitch a bunch of clips together to make one long movie.<br /><br />The only downside, other than the basicness of the features, is that you will occasionally hear the DVD spinning.  It's kind of a wobbling sound, but it's common on a lot of DVD camcorders, I guess.<br /><br />So, if you're a casual video jockey, a teenage girl looking for a way to make naughty videos for her captain of the football team boyfriend, or a lonely fat guy wanting to make a special show for the lady across the street...this camera is for you.

The manual could be a little clearer, explaining about format etc. Of course I am impatient and usually reread the instructions after not getting it right the first time, so I will give it 5 stars. I ended up spending more money than expected, extra battery, another charger etc. I also purchased the extended service plan, but I figured the large investment was worth it.

"Are you looking for a network streaming box for your TV?  #1 choice could be the Apple TV  Apple TV is a fantastic product and I use one myself at work and if you have other Apple products at home this is the way to go, it works seamlessly with your other Apple devices.  But, I received a notification by email from Amazon about a sale on the Sony SMP-n200 streaming player for only $48 it caught my eye.  Probably because I had been searching Amazon for an Apple TV V2.  After doing a little research it looked like a great value.  It arrived a couple of days later and it took only a few minutes to get ready to go...so I thought...BUT...A time consuming issue after it is on your network is that MANY apps/etc. need to be set up individually.  It would be great if it could have been done from one setup page.  The remote is simple and easy to navigate.  Too bad that much thought wasn't put into the onscreen GUI.  The navigation screen is simple, like the PSP, Playstation etc.  The problem is the thumbnails are sooooooo small when viewing cover art etc. that you have to get up off of the couch and stand close to the TV to make them out.  WORK THAT OUT SONY!  On the plus side the SMP-n200 has composite, component and HDMI output for any kind of TV! It also has a full size USB port on the side and supports lots of video formats.  I slipped a thumb drive in, and it played a video I had saved, no problem, and it looked great!  I really purchased it for Netflix streaming, but I was concerned that my less than stellar internet connection (1.4mbps on a good day) would cause problems.  I am shocked, I have watched hours of programming and it hasn't buffered once and the picture is darn near DVD quality. And it seems like every time I turn it on it has more straming options.

"This camcorder may seem like a decent deal... but by the time you add one battery (which is pretty much a minimum, since the battery life is so short), and a charger (no... the camcorder really doesn't come with a charger) you add 25% to the price. Make that two batteries and a charger (the ideal kit) and you almost double the price. Without buying the charger, you are forced to use the camcorder as the charger. This is very inconvenient.<br /><br />Now, this wouldn't be a problem if they didn't have proprietary batteries or the camcorder didn't detect any attempts to use non-Sony batteries. You can get generic batteries on Amazon and elsewhere that say they will work for this model, but they will not. They've recently updated the camcorder to detect more (or all?) non-Sony batteries and give an error message, shutting down. Generic batteries that worked with the DVD403 do not work with the DVD405.<br /><br />By the way, if you are considering some of their lighting accessories, beware that these also take their proprietary batteries, and probably a different model than you need for the camcorder... leaving a whole 'nother set of overpriced batteries you have to buy.<br /><br />I bought this camcorder but I'm not going to be buying any hundred dollar batteries any time soon so I sent it back.

"I bought this camera after reading recommendations on Consumer Reports website. It's a pretty good camera, but perhaps I should have bought something else. Here are the reasons for that: 1) the editing is not easy; 2) colors seem to be washed out, along with the focus; 3) camera broke down after 18 months of use. For the last bullet, it appeared to be some kind of internal electronic malfunction, resulting in complete failure when using camera in moderate sunlight situations (the screen goes white): only when the amount of sun/light is fairly low, will it function.

"You can find a better deal with a 1.0GB Memory Stick Duo with either SanDisk or Lexar. Sony's memory sticks are very expensive against the competitors but they work best with the Sony products. I bought this for my Sony PlayStation Portable so I could store music, games, pictures, and music. One thing I learned is that you shouldn't get a high-capacity memory stick! One thing is that if you want to watch movies you have to convert your files to MPEG-4 which is so much more work! Another thing is with your CD's and stuff like that you have to convert them only to MP3 and ATRAC3 format. For pictures it has to be JPEG only which is another hassle. I have a card reader on my computer and guess what...it doesn't support Memory Stick Duo! It only supports MS and MS PRO. I've heard you have to buy a Sony computer to have a card reader with Memory Stick Duo capability. I am very disappointed with Sony with their new UMD and Memory Stick Duo. They should have added 1.0GB internal built-in memory so you can start downloading all those things instantly. The PSP should have also included a Mini-B USB Connector too because it's so cheap!

"I purchased the camcorder on April 5; took about a week to get it.  Used it three times using the battery that came with it.  I then purchased two SONY NP-FP90 battery packs, charged them and installed one on the camcorder.  The camcorder booted up and I got the message...""use InfoLITHIUM battery packs"" and the unit shut down.  I tried several times with the same result.  I then installed the second NP-FP90 battery pack with the same result.  I emailed Sony support and they said I would have to send the unit in.  I shipped the camcorder on April 24, the service center received it on April 27.  I followed the servicing of the camcorder on line which indicated that the camcorder was being serviced on April 28.  On about May 3, it said that service was delayed as a part is on order.<br /><br />It is my understanding that fixing the unit could take up to 10 days with an extra 2 weeks to get the part.  I called and was told that the part ordered is a battery.  I inquired as to the part number of the battery but the girl couldn't (or wouldn't) tell me.  I wanted to find out if the part was another NP-FP90 which would be a waste of time since I already tried two.  That was indicated on the paperwork I sent to them with the camcorder.<br /><br />I ordered the unit to take videos of my grandchildren and so far I have missed out on several soccer games, a youth olympics day, a school recognition night, etc. with more upcoming events that I won't be able to video.<br /><br />I have been talking with customer service at Sony asking that, because the camcorder was virtually new, could they see that the part is overnighted to the service center; could they send me a NEW camcorder; and on and on.  So far I have been without my camcorder for longer than I had it.  Customer service says they will call me back in 24 hours; they didn't.  They take notes and say they will pass them on to ??someone??  I can't imagine a Sony service center that doesn't have necessary parts on hand.<br /><br />The Sony is a good camcorder, but god forbid you ever need service.

"I bought this camcorder in hopes to free myself from digital8 tapes and upgrade to better video quality. I did free myself from tapes but after reviewing the footage captured by the DVD405 I was very disappointed to find out how bad the picture quality was..I  would compare the video quality to a vhs-c camcorder..I think maybe I had too much expectation from the DVD405 but I felt I took a step backward when I bought this camcorder. My previous camcorder (Sony digital8 TRV120)which I've had for 6 years, captures way better(sharper) video than the DVD405 in my opinion. I felt like I was getting a headache when I was watching the footage of my sons baseball award ceremony which was shot in the afternoon sunlight with minimal movement..The edges of the subjects in the footage was somewhat pixelated..  mpeg2 compression needs to improve a little bit more for me to come back to dvd camcorders so I decided to return the DVD405 back to amazon(smooth process) and stick with my digital 8 for now.. Sony is suppose to come out with a Hi-Def dvd camcorder in the near future (Sony HDR-UX1) so I might wait for that to come out. I have been looking at Sony's 30GB HDD camcorder which is supposed to have higher resolution than the DVD405 but I would still have to transfer footage to dvd.....-right now I've just been trying to be patient and shop around and do my research...All in all, the only reason I would have kept this DVD405 is for convenience of recording straight to dvd.. Buy this camcorder if you want this convenience and if you dont mind mediocre video footage..Maybe the newer DVD505 is better than this model.

"As a little background, I received a different Sony Cybershot as a gift after a succession of Canon point-and-shoots over the past 15 or so years, all of which I loved. The Sony was disclaimed as an experiment, since Canon hasn't produced a camera I loved as much as the SD750 since that model. The chosen Sony didn't have quite my hoped-for configuration of upgrades from the 750, so I was encouraged to exchange it and after pretty exhaustive research, I traded up to the HX7V. I LOVE this camera.<br /><br />I've only taken a few minutes of video, and while it's really good, it's not why I wanted this camera or why I like it so much. It just takes great pictures, with enough megapixels and a broad enough focal range to be extremely versatile, as it very accurately claims. I couldn't take pictures of anything large with my SD750 that was less than 10 feet from me, but with the Sony, I can take a full-length picture of somebody standing just a couple steps away. Frankly, the Canon beats it on macro quality, but not by much, and it's much easier to use effectively on the Sony.<br /><br />A few things about other modes... The continuous panoramic mode on the Sony is very cool but not the main draw for me. What's really amazing is the burst mode, so fast it's practically frame-by-frame video. Sure, it takes a few seconds to process the series, but if you want to just sit with the shutter button pressed down, get a DSLR or just shoot video, for crying out loud. I have NO complaints about a series of pictures that CLEARLY capture a hummingbird feeding and flying away (on Action setting, in burst mode), everything sharp but the wings, for which you need A LOT more camera for A LOT more money. It's also amazing in low light, apparently largely because of the CMOS sensor it shares with good Canons. Hand-held twilight mode gives me pictures I never thought I'd get from a compact. With no tripod and the camera on full zoom, I took pictures of the moon that show the craters on the soft edge, that you can only see when it's not full, with at least decent binoculars. I repeat, nice moon pictures WITH NO TRIPOD. That just doesn't happen, so it's the best example I can think of. For kicks (i.e. because I didn't believe it could do it), I've taken pictures in a completely dark room with no flash, and it actually finds the object and with minimal light, as from a streetlight outside or a nightlight in an adjacent room, it takes a recognizable picture. The fact that it can even find something to focus on is amazing, let alone that it will take its picture.  All that to say that this is a serious light sensor. Clearly, pictures taken in a dark room are not Pulitzer prize winners, but my point is that this camera has this kind of capability, and if you just bother to play with the settings and learn how to use it right, it will meet just about any challenge you can give it. Another setting that's really great blurs the background, simulating a low aperture as on a SLR, for a really shallow depth of field. It's not always flawless, but without studying it, you'd swear you took those pictures with a different camera. And also worth noting is the backlight correction. I don't remember ever taking a picture against a bright background (sky, sunset, etc) that didn't show the foreground as completely black, unless I ""tricked"" the camera by focusing on the foreground and holding the shutter button halfway until I went back up to get the sky in it. Then of course, the sky's completely white, so that wasn't exactly a win either. The HX7V actually corrects for that somehow and balances it out, without any ""tricking."" Again, I'm sure it's not going to be ""perfect"" to a professional/studio photographer, but I take an awful lot of pictures, and I like to take good pictures, and it's better than I'd expected or even hoped for in a less than a thousand-dollar camera.<br /><br />That said, I've taken most of my pictures on the intelligent auto setting, because after leaving it there and paying attention to the settings it chose, I saw that it was usually going with the settings I would have chosen anyway, or using ones that made for better pictures than I would have taken if left to my own impulses. The very few times it hasn't, I've changed it, pretty simple. There's an enormous range of automatic and manual options for a camera of this size and price range, and anything it doesn't have, I definitely haven't missed, if I've noticed it at all. Color is true, both on the card and on the LCD screen, and everything is incredibly easy to use, and bear in mind that this is coming from somebody who had used only the Canon interface on all previous digital cameras. Battery life is also great, and it will use generics if you want to pick up a spare for few bucks.<br /><br />I still think Canon makes a great camera, although they seem to be stuck in some feature/design/size/price area for the past couple years that doesn't meet my needs or wants. Even at 3 years old (and with no IS), the SD750 took many beautiful pictures for me and was only seriously limited by low megapixels, minimal zoom, and sort of weird indoor color and light usage. We still have a couple of Canons in the house, and the Rebel can't be beaten, in my opinion, for a full-size DSLR. We recently got a used Panasonic Lumix FS-22 for one of the kids, and it's a great camera, too, my preference for my own replacement until I got ahold of this Sony HX7V. The Sony was brought in on a trial run and not staying if it did not outperform every other point-and-shoot in the house, and it's still here, so that sums it up as well as anything could.",0.7111111111111111,159.95,0.19849140211640207,0.4669766342652119,PlayStation

"I am a GIS Specialist, just returned from a 2 week archaeological expedition in Eastern and Southern Mongolia.  I bought this camera to simplify data collection, and it takes beautiful shots, but the GPS is just complete garbage.  After syncing the assist data, the unit still discharged the battery TWICE before obtaining a lock on 4 satellites.  Thereafter, it took from 3-5 minutes every time I powered up for the GPS to obtain a fix.  This was on the Eastern Mongolian Steppe, with not a building for 500km, I've just given up on getting a fix anywhere in the city.  It just doesn't work.  My Garmin Etrex and Trimble Juno SB units had no trouble getting a fix within about 10 seconds each, regardless of how long they had been off and most of the time I had a lock on 6-8 satellites on these units.  The Sony, however, consistently needed minutes to fix, even if I turned it off with a fix and turned it back on.  There just isn't any excuse for this kind of poor performance out of modern GPS enabled equipment.  My Google Nexus S phone got a GPS fix faster than this thing.  I finally abandoned the idea of using this camera for fieldwork, and shot pics with my Trimble Juno SB.  It does, however, shoot beautiful video and pics, which is good, but not good enough.

"We only have an &#34;up to&#34; 3 Gb internet connection, so it's been hard to find streaming players that work well with this connection. For the price, I'm a huge fan of this player.<br />Sony Google-TV players don't seem to have all the bugs worked out (I don't know this from personal experience, I'm just basing this on the multitudes of reviews and the research I've done), so I went with this one, which seems to be a slower-processing and weaker-antenna'd (for wireless connections) version of my Playstation 3 (which is fine for several hundred dollars less than the Playstation).<br />It plays Blu-rays and DVD formats. It has a Netflix button on the remote and streams programs well from Hulu Plus and Netflix (I haven't tried any other services on it yet). It also has internet access via a search engine and capabilities of media sharing from other devices. Seniors in the household have been managing to use this without problems, so I'm very impressed with it's usability.<br />My only complaint is that I have it (and nothing else) prioritized on my router (which means it should receive the majority of the internet signal when other devices are running-so the other devices should show lag-should buffer/reload-while this should not show any) and it still has to buffer/reload on Netflix when I'm using something like Amazon video on another TV (Netflix runs smoothly when used on both TVs-it's only when the second TV is running a higher-definition service). I haven't researched in depth, but I believe this is because it only uses the 2.4 Ghz signal band of my dual-band router, while my other devices use both the 2.4 Ghz and the 5 Ghz. I could be incorrect, but I can't think of another reason for the lag.<br />As long as I stick to Netflix on this and my other device, I can usually run two computers on the internet at the same time, with maybe only a little slow webpage loading on the computer (not the fault of this Sony), and no lag/reloading on the Sony or my other streaming device.

It was a reliable brand name with which I felt comfortable; they'd never before steered me wrong and I saw no reason to take any expensive chances with other brand names that might let me down or perform below my expectations.<br /><br />So when I decided to purchase a digital camcorder it seemed only logical that I should look at what Sony was offering. Judging by its technical specifications, the Webbie HD seemed, like all of my other Sony purchases, to fit the bill with flying colors: An SD card camera, it allows users to utilize memory cards the way one used to use VHS tapes. Simply stick the card into the camera, and record; when you run out of time, simply download the media to a DVD, your computer, or some other storage device, wipe the SD card, and it's ready to go again. Couple this with the camera's manageable size, durability, amazing zoom feature, and HD capabilities, and it would seem that it's the total package.<br /><br />For roughly $200, one couldn't ask for more in a camcorder, especially one that produces so crisp a picture and is also capable of taking relatively sharp still photos (lacking a flash, the camera's only apparent drawback is that it is not suited for low-light situations; a small flashlight bulb is built into the front of the camera as a means of compensation, but it's rather weak and doesn't provide much illumination beyond a foot or so). The resolution is some of the cleanest I've seen on a digital camcorder, easily rivaling ""professional"" quality HD camcorders. The menus are simple to use and easy to learn, and out of the box I was already recording and deleting without having read through the instruction manual. Theoretically, even the most technically inept individual could easily pick up and use the Webbie within an hour or so's time. The only questionable feature, upon first inspection, is that the battery is internal, and the camera itself must be plugged in for recharging to take place. This also means that, should some damage befall the battery or should it begin to degrade, one would have to either send it into Sony for repair or scrap it altogether. However, for someone who takes reasonable care of their camera, or who can/intends to use it primarily plugged into the wall during recording, this is at worst what can be considered a minor drawback. Fully charged, the battery allows for roughly two hours of HD recording; certainly nothing to sneeze at.<br /><br />Unfortunately, all of this is meaningless. Sony made a decision to intentionally cripple its own products, and therein lies the major flaw of the Webbie-- a flaw so glaring that it makes the camera useless for even home movies and the most amateur of filmmakers.<br /><br />If you haven't already done so, go read over the camera's technical specifications. Read them on Amazon, read them on Sony's webpage. Find any and all consumer information you can. Missing from all of this information is the fact that the camera is programmed to record in 25 minute intervals and then shut itself off. If you're confused by this, you're in good company. Upon reading it in the instruction manual-- buried in the middle amongst information on SD card recording capacity-- I was confused, and thought that it must either be a typo or a misprint regarding the size of SD card being used. However, upon conducting testing with various size SD cards-- 4GB, 8GB-- it quickly became apparent that the manual was correct. Regardless of the size of SD card placed into the Webbie, once it has recorded for 25 minutes, the camera shuts off recording.<br /><br />A phone call to Sony's customer service shed light on the situation: Per the company, this ""feature"" is a ""security precaution"" meant to protect the camera's integrity by not ""overloading"" it. When I asked if the company planned any sort of firmware upgrade to the camera to allow it to record for longer intervals, I was informed that the company has no plans to update or otherwise upgrade the Webbie in any way, shape, or form, and was advised that if I wanted a camera that recorded for more than 25 minutes, I should look into some of Sony's other models-- all of which were well into the $400-$500 range.<br /><br />A quick consultation with some techno-geeks revealed the situation to be utterly hopeless: By virtue of the camera's design, there is no way to even modify the camera oneself to allow for more recording time. Sony not only designed the camera to only record for 25 minutes, they went to every length necessary to ensure nothing could be done about it.<br /><br />The Webbie is now back where it came from, after a great deal of grief, most notably from Sony, who tried in vain to convince me first that I should have read all of the literature (until I informed them of the extent of my research and noted that information regarding the 25 minute feature ONLY appears in the product manual) and then attempted to talk me into dropping another $300 on another model. No such luck. After this experience, I can no longer fully trust Sony; if a company is willing to not only release an intentionally flawed product onto the market, but cover that fact up by leaving it out of technical specifications, they have no qualms about deceiving their customers in other matters as well.<br /><br />If you're considering this product, I strongly advise you to check into JVC's Everio GZ-MS120 line of digital camcorders. Also utilizing the SD feature, the quality isn't quite HD, but fairly comparable, especially for a non-HD camera. It's essentially the same camera as the Webbie, minus everything wrong with the Webbie. The menus are a bit more complex, and the price runs a little bit higher, but for these losses there are remarkable advantages (external, upgradeable batteries permitting up to eight hours recording time; an LED light capable of actually lighting up a room, as compared to the Webbie's weak bulb). At the very least, stay away from the Webbie, and save yourself the trouble I had to go through.",0.8666666666666667,169.98,0.060898736037624954,0.4413274844109033,PlayStation
"PROS: This camera takes pretty good pictures, the colors are bright, and the 10x zoom is great, panorama mode is a great feature for landscape shots like China's Great Wall.<br /><br />CONS: This camera is very SLOW - seems like processor is underpowered, or the software is bloated and slow.  Every operation takes longer than you would like - after a while it becomes annoying and you begin to question if you'll ever buy another Sony camera.<br /><br />1) Power up - Turn on - takes at least 5 seconds before zoom will respond<br />2) Going into browse mode - sometimes takes 4-5 seconds where the screen is dark and camera is non-responsive.  Trying to ZOOM in browse mode - responsiveness is quite sluggish.<br />3) REC button is in a very awkward spot - very easy to hit it accidentally with your right thumb as you hold the cammera, especially if you try to zoom the shot.  I think Sony did human factors testing with very tiny handed models.<br />4) Takes nearly 5 seconds to start recording video once you hit ""REC"" button, camera becomes unresponsive for another 5 seconds when you hit REC again to stop recording.  An accidental push of the REC button costs you 10 seconds and many lost shots.",0.7111111111111111,159.95,0.146265664160401,0.4408637652872114,PlayStation

"I owned this camera for about two weeks before returning it.  It was a fun camera and I was happy with the output.  I think the feature set is pretty incredible.<br /><br />So why did I return it?  I returned it because the camera is terribly sluggish in terms of all of the controls.  The shooting performance is actually quite good.  What is bad is things like simply pressing menu buttons and zooming.  There is a good 2 second delay doing even the most simple things with the camera and the camera gives no indication that is busy when it is not responding to you.<br /><br />Here are some examples:<br /><br />- When switching modes the camera takes about 4-5 seconds to become usable again<br />- When pressing the video button while on a still shooting mode the camera takes a whopping 9 seconds to start recording video (this drops to about 4 if you have the dial set to video already)  I can only guess that this is 4-5 seconds for the camera to change to video mode and another 4 to start recording.  Completely unacceptable and frustrating this was the final deal breaker for me with this camera.<br />- When you take a picture and quickly want to review it the playback button is unresponsive for 2-3 seconds.  Note that the camera does not say ""Processing"" or show an hour glass, or give any feedback that what you are trying to do is not possible.<br />- Within playback mode the zoom does not become usable until 2-3 seconds after the photo is displayed.  Once it does it will jump around rather than zooming smoothly.<br />- When shooting the zoom is slow to respond and sometimes jumpy as well.<br /><br />I tried a super high speed memory card and that only improved the time to review a photo after taking it.  Everything else remained slow.<br /><br />Honestly I loved pretty much everything about how the camera handled and what it could do.<br /><br />In the end this camera is frustrating and utterly unusable with these drawbacks.",0.7111111111111111,159.95,0.09728395061728398,0.4163729085156529,PlayStation
"I expected good features when I bought this as it was Sony and it was one of the higher end Blue Ray players they offer.  Gracenote, the little interface it has, is HORRIBLE and slow.  After it got its last update it stopped streaming from my network NAS.  It worked before the update not after.  I had to a bunch of research, sony support said it was my network, which just told me they don't know what they are talking about.  I fixed it by renaming the library.  Then another update and I had to do it again.  I thought it would have all the same streaming channels as the Playstation, I don't play video games so I bought this instead, but it DOES NOT.  Hardware wise I like the USB, I like the audio and quality of image, I HATE how slow it is operating.  Sometimes I wait several minutes for a Blue ray to load. No rhyme or reason it just decided that time, it will take forever.  I am not sure I will be buying sony for my next player of any sort, even after years of loyalty.

"This thing is our absolute favorite ever since we got it! We watch movies, TV shows, play games (by hooking up PlayStation) anywhere around the house. When its not in *active* use, it is displaying family collage frames or displaying art from 500px in our living room or in home office (for friends and guests).<br /><br />The picture quality is impressive and extra controls (Picture Settings in the app) are great. Project it on table or wall and you'll be pleasantly surprised as far as the room/place is not too bright.<br /><br />My favorites:<br />1) Picture quality<br />Preset picture setting is pretty good but if you like you can adjust to brightness, contrast, saturation, sharpness and white balance using Picture Settings in the app.<br />2) Screen Mirroring (Miracast)<br />One of the best implementations I have seen so far (smooth without a lag or interruption).

"Ok; after long research for a mega zoom pocket camera, it all came down to two options: Nikon Coolpix 9100, and Sony DSC-HX9V. On the Amazon customer reviews, Nikon got pretty bad grades in terms of the mechanical of the zoom, and although it was cheaper than Sony's, I had to go for a safer functioning camera. Now, bear in mind that I have had the camera for a couple of days, but last night I had my daughters year end ballet act: AWESOME! I'm a regular P&S person, and did a very good job yesterday, to the point that my friend using his sophisticated DSLR asked for my pics; on top of that, I also filmed the show, and it was AWESOME  (did I said it before?); I just saw the end product last night and was very impressed. Granted I had a first generation tapeless Handycam which is crap compared to what you get from the DSC-HX9V. Anyway, all of what everybody said in this forum is true: Very good picture quality in low light conditions, fast output, superb video, great panorama function, small enough to fit in your pocket, great to use either hand held or with a tripod. Yes, flash position could be better, but in a few clicks I've gotten used to its position, and manage the camera well enough.<br /><br />As for my fellow Mac users, you will require additional software to import your movies to iMovie (at least 1080p/60 ones). The way to go is Clipwrap [...]; it is truly fast, that's is because there is no re-encoding, and proper .mov archive outputs from this software; it preserves the video quality, and then is so easy to use iMovie, that you will look professional.<br /><br />I'm very satisfied with this camera, that doubles as a great P&S camera, and a great video camera (I'm selling my old Sony videocam!)",0.9333333333333333,,0.3195345345345346,,PlayStation

"After reading the reviews here on Amazon, I knew this was the HDTV I wanted.  A 37"" set was all I had room for in my limited space.  So I started watching the prices afer Black Friday last year.  The price came down some as Christmas got closer, but still more than I was willing to spend.<br /><br />Then, in Mar 2009, I noticed from Sony's website that this particular model was no longer available - being phased out.  I knew I had to act fast, so I grabbed one of the last ones I could find.  Boy, am I glad I did!<br /><br />This was our first HDTV and thanks to the reviewers here, they led me to the right choice.  Granted, I don't have another set to easily compare this to, but in my opinion, the picture quality is fantastic!  My HD source is Verizon FiOS and the highest quality output they have is 1080i.<br /><br />Setup was a snap.  Three screws and the base was attached.  Installed the Verizon HD set top box, connected the HDMI cable, my audio out cable and bingo, I was watching high definition.  There were only a few of the default settings that I had to change.<br /><br />The Sony may have been a little more expensive, but the results were well worth it.

"My Onkyo receiver died, and I needed a replacement that worked with my existing Onkyo speakers that were already mounted.  Sony to the rescue!<br /><br />All of my devices are connected via HDMI, and I'm at the max of 4 devices for the receiver.  You can buy an HDMI switcher much cheaper than buying a receiver with more than 4 connections!  Not a problem for me.<br /><br />The sound quality is excellent; just as good as my Onkyo TX-SR606!  The setup is very very easy - you can use the automatic configuration using the microphone distance tool, or manually configure.<br /><br />I'm using my bluetooth/RF remote for my PS3 to control the receiver, and it works perfectly.<br /><br />Update - 02/05/2014<br />I often connect my 2011 iMac to the receiver to display my desktop onto my TV.  I do this with an adapter from monoprice and a long HDMI cable.  There were no issues doing this with my previous Onkyo receiver; however, I've noticed with the Sony receiver I can not leave the cable connected when I'm not wanting to screen mirror.  It seems to cause random issues of the iMac screen not coming on after sleep mode or the screen flashing 5-10 times after come back to full power.  If I plug the cable in and display, it works fine; but I just unplug after I'm done mirroring to avoid the issues.  Not horrendous, but would have preferred a seamless usage.",0.911111111111111,,0.2652380952380953,,PlayStation
"This camera isn't the be-all, end-all of point and shoot photography. No, it makes some compromises with its small sensor, slow lens, and below average battery life. So why the TX9 for me? (actually, more for my wife...)<br /><br /> + Excellent no-flash low-light / indoor performance, aka ""party shots"" or ""friends out to dinner."" It achieves this by taking multiple shots at high shutter speeds in succession, avoiding motion blurring, then stitching them together. And it really works, as long as you get the shot right in the camera and don't try to lighten it in post processing (or then you'll see the lack of detail and empty zombie eyes).<br /><br /> + Wonderful wide angle shooting, which is unheard of on cameras of this size. If you're unsure of this, TRUST ME, it's SOOOOO valuable in any number of situations, such as a group shot of friends in a small room (""Everybody lean in!"") or capturing the kids or dogs up close without removing them from their environment, or capturing tall buildings and cityscapes in their whole. Wide angles add so much flexibility to the shot composition.<br /><br /> + Excellent HD movie mode, with the press of a dedicated button. The picture quality is wonderful. Heck, watching it back on the large touch screen is excellent. Zooming while recording is silent. My only complaints are that the lens is very close to the edge, so we need to be careful of where our left fingers are if we're holding the camera with both hands or else they'll end up in the shot, and the stereo microphones are on the front face of the camera and so tend to pick up a lot of wind noise (other cameras place the mics on top).<br /><br /> + Uses SDHC memory cards! Goodbye overpriced Sony Memory Stick and your pesky adapters! Hello, inexpensive and plentiful Class 6 SDHC.<br /><br /> + The touchscreen is actually a joy to use. I was surprised. Seriously. (Though it does get filled up with fingerprints really fast!) The loss of the traditional mode dial made this camera instant best friends with my wife, who ""just wants to take pictures."" And in full-auto mode, the camera does a very good job of selecting the appropriate shooting mode for the conditions.<br /><br /> + Small! Thin! Portable! Doesn't need a case! This is the camera that I can truly ""always have with me."" Slide the cover down and it's ready to shoot.<br /><br /> + Panorama mode actually works. I don't mind stitching photos together in Photoshop -- in fact, from prior experience with the WX1, Photoshop is preferable in most instances -- but this is great for slapping something together in a pinch and is more than adequate for displaying on Facebook or emailing.<br /><br /> + The docking base, while admittedly a little annoying to me, means the proprietary Sony cable doesn't get lost (oh, Sony, why can't you just embrace standard USB connections like everyone else?!?) -AND- no opening the slot to remove the SD card to stick it in the computer to upload pics.<br /><br />This camera is everything [[ASIN:B002IPHIFA Sony's WX1]] was supposed to be, except that it actually produces good photos in bright daylight (the WX1 fell flat on its face in these conditions, with awful washed out sky and blown highlights a'plenty). The dynamic range of the TX9 still isn't great, but it's better than any cell phone camera I've used. If we're headed somewhere where we know we'll be taking pictures, I'll reach for my [[ASIN:B003WJR69E Panasonic LX5]] or [[ASIN:B000GHVZQ0 FZ50]], but for those spur of the moment opportunities where the kid is doing something irresistible or where we want to walk around unencumbered, the TX9 is turning out to be the perfect fit. And it's so small, it can live in my wife's purse without getting in her way.<br /><br />Due to the limited battery life, I picked up a spare [[ASIN:B0035FVHJ0 Sony NPBN1 Rechargeable Battery]] which came in retail blister pack packaging and appears to be the genuine Sony product for a decent price. Watch out for the knockoff and aftermarket batteries on the auction sites -- they always disappoint me with lower capacities resulting in shorter run times.",0.8,,0.1722026619716837,,PlayStation

Even better, the DISH remote can be set up to control the volume on the sound bar.  BUT, I cannot switch from TV/HDMI to Optical when we go from TV to PS3 without the sound bar's remote control.

"What can I say, this TV is great. It's slim, and looks absolutely stunning. It turns on much faster than my 2009 Sony that I used to have. The menus are fairly clean and the internet connectivity is awesome! It updates it's own firmware!<br /><br />Anyways, It took some adjusting, but I'm using the VIVID preset with a few minor changes. There is no noticeable input lag which is awesome for anyone who plays games. I also have this hooked up to my PC through HDMI and boy does it look good! I have honestly never seen a picture so sharp and colors so vivid. 1080p is well worth it.<br /><br />There are only two cons that I can think of. First, there was one screw missing on the stand, but that's not a huge deal. Second, Sony will not warranty this TV at all. I should have known this, being it is an open box or ""used"" TV, but Samsung will still warranty their TV's sold on Amazon's Warehouse. Ah, oh well.

It also when turned on will automatically turn on the blu ray player and but if you want to use something else you have to wait for the Blu Ray to finish all its stuff before you can switch input or else it will continue to revert back to the blu ray.

"This is by far one of the most curious marketing/packaging ideas that I've ever seen.<br /><br />I mean a ""kitchen edition""?  Really???  The more I thought about it, however, the more it made sense.  The build of this tablet is impressive in that its water-resistant to a depth of 3' for up to 30 minutes.  For kitchen use, that means that water splashes aren't going to phase this remarkably light tablet one bit.  The inclusion of a Bluetooth meat thermometer is also pretty cool and it works really well with the iGrill app which shows the temperature on a real-time graph as well as having an alarm to trigger when the temperature is right.  Are you cooking 2 things at once?  Well, this meat thermometer features TWO probes each capable of being triggered at different temperatures.  Pretty neat.<br /><br />The included stand for ""recipe reading"" is also pretty neat and will reduce kitchen counter clutter with this thin tablet considerably.  The included applications for food shopping and recipes are nice as well.<br /><br />Ultimately, however, is this worth $100 more than its plain-nothing-else-included 32 GB brother?  Considering how much the thermometer is by itself (see the black version here:  [[ASIN:B007NDWP46 iDevices iGrill Grilling/Cooking Barbecue Thermometer with Dual Probe, Black]]) and the apps would be, it would appear that the bundle is being provided at full MSRP.  You could feasibly buy these individually which really makes the choice dependent upon whether or not the features of the tablet itself are to your liking or not.<br /><br />So, on to the tablet!<br /><br />ERGONOMICS/WEIGHT<br /><br />Out of the box, I was both amazed by how THIN this tablet was (thinner than a pencil!) and by how light it was. At merely over 1 lb, this tablet weighs only 2 OUNCES more than my 7"" Kindle Fire HD. The very thin profile of this tablet also makes it amazingly easy to hold and grip. I did wind up purchasing a case for it MoKo Slim Cover Case for Sony Xperia Tablet Z 10.1 inch, Black (with Flip Stand, Integrated Elastic Hand Strap, and Stylus Loop)-Lifetime Warranty, and even the additional bulk of this case made it easy to hold and the wrist strap on this case completed abated my ergonomic concerns. Top marks.<br /><br />STARTUP<br /><br />This thing kicks on in a hurry. I didn't even get to 7 seconds before this thing was fully booted up and ready to go. The quad-core processor probably has a lot to do with this.<br /><br />OPERATION/PERFORMANCE<br /><br />The quad core 1.5 GHz processor appears to work fast...blazingly FAST. There is no noticeable lag starting up any of my applications and was able to run a couple without any noticeable degradation in performance.  However, there are faster offerings out now and it seems like Sony is just a small step behind...the problems of a rapidly changing tech world.<br /><br />The wireless connection snapped to my router immediately and makes use of either my ""g"" or ""n"" bandwidths as I choose. I have a Samsung Galaxy III which I use as a mobile hot spot and the Sony connected to it in stride, able to make full use of the speeds that I had available. (I have a 40 Mbps connection at home).<br /><br />SCREEN/DISPLAY<br /><br />The image is stunning - the 1920 x 1200 display is pure eye candy and watching movies in HD on it is a portable wonder.<br /><br />BRIGHTNESS CONTROL<br /><br />The Sony does have a separate sensor for automatic brightness control if you want to conserve your battery to the maximum intent possible.<br /><br />At maximum brightness, the Sony's display is eye-piercingly brilliant...I don't think that I would want it any brighter at all. Contrast is very well done (with some of the limitations that you expect with LCDs, but top marks nonetheless) and colors are very well produced and rich without oversaturation.<br /><br />SOUND QUALITY<br /><br />Simply ok. The onboard speakers get the job done, but I found the Kindle speakers to be more impressive as a standalone audio device. That said, I typically use my headphones or my Bluetooth speaker anyway, so this is not a huge disappointment for me. The sound through the headphones/Bluetooth speaker is quite good.<br /><br />BATTERY LIFE<br /><br />I'd say that the battery life is probably a good 8.5 to 9.5 hours depending on your usage, the quality of your wireless connection (AND if it's on), whether you have GPS on/off, and/or your brightness setting. It's on par with most tablets these days and I haven't noticed any significant variance between this tablet, my Kindle, or the Samsung Tab.<br /><br />MEMORY<br /><br />This model came with 32 GB on-board, but you can insert a microSD card for additional memory, unlike the Kindle (hope you're STILL listening Amazon - memory expandability is STILL my biggest pet peeve with the Kindle Fire HD). I placed a 32 GB Sandisk memory card in there and I dropped in a couple of movies that I like to watch from time to time.<br /><br />The current Android OS doesn't allow aps to be installed on the microSD card, however. I have heard rumors that the 4.2 Android update should allow this again and Sony is supposed to be getting this update.  I did manage to install the update and I'm saddened to report that apps are still confined to on-board memory.  I'm pretty disappointed with this as this is definitely geared towards forcing the buyer to pay the premium associated with memory alone.  Considering the speed of some microSD cards these days, it's silly not to allow that as an option on faster cards.<br /><br />The memory limit for me comes as one area for improvement (see Room For Improvements below).<br /><br />CHARGING<br /><br />I'm glad that Sony has opted the use of micro USB input for file transfer and power. The device comes with an AC adapter for that purpose, but the micro USB cable input grants you flexibility if you need it.  However, this charging cradle which allows charging without opening any ports is DEFINITELY worth a look ([[ASIN:B00CDINKE0 Sony IT Charging Cradle for Xperia Tablet Z (SGPDS5)]]).<br /><br />HDMI<br /><br />I have not tested the HDMI output but I rarely find a reason to use it since I already have a PS3 for Netflix and video viewing anyway, but an HDMI output is available on this unit. It also has a 3.5 mm jack for headphones.<br /><br />BLUETOOTH<br /><br />Another plus is the Bluetooth capability of the device and if you have a Bluetooth portable speaker, it's great to use with the tablet. I have a Monster Bluetooth portable speaker and it sounds great.<br /><br />WATER RESISTIVITY<br /><br />Remarkably, this unit is water RESISTANT to a depth of 3 feet of water for up to 30 minutes. While I don't advocate a ""check this out"" approach, the piece of mind knowing that I could read this in a bathtub, hot tub, next to the kitchen sink, etc., without having to worry about collateral splash damage is a very, very nice feature. All of the ports (HDMI, microSD, micro USB, and headphones) have a special cover requiring fingernails to pop open. When you shut them, they fit back with a reassuring fit to ensure water resistance. But it's only water resistant when these ports are sealed.<br /><br />REMOTE CONTROL<br /><br />It's a neat little feature - you can use this tablet as a remote control!! You can select the brand, the type of device that you want to control, and with a little troubleshooting of finding the right IR schemes, you're on your way. It took me about 2 minutes to get my TV up and running...there is even a manual setup if you want to get even fancier than that. We own a pair of Logitech remotes, however, so we don't have too much use for it. But my limited testing shows that this feature works quite well.<br /><br />CAMERA<br /><br />The 8 megapixel camera that's included on the back takes pretty good pictures. Like with any smartphone, you just need to have adequate light (see Room For Improvements below). You can also shoot HD footage on it, but I don't see how easy that would be to use compared to a conventional camcorder. In a pinch, however, it works pretty well. The 2 megapixel camera on the front also works well and is satisfactory for Skype usage.<br /><br />SONY ENTERTAINMENT<br /><br />We have a PS3 at home and we subscribe to Music Unlimited. While this is an app that's available on smartphones, it has received poor reviews from people who have not been able to use it. It works just fine on this tablet, however!<br /><br />In addition, you can connect to your online PS3 account to see what's new, what you have downloaded, etc. However, I wish that it could do more (see Room For Improvements below).<br /><br />FM RADIO<br /><br />Ok, not as many people listen to the radio anymore, but including this feature on a tablet is a cool factor for my wife. Your headphones act as the antenna. It's not as good as your car, but if you're listening in town, it works quite well. Just don't expect it to work as great on the fringes where your car encounters some static (you probably won't get anything on the tablet at all).<br /><br />ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENTS<br /><br />1. LED light. Seriously, Sony, how did you not think of incorporating an LED light next to the camera? They don't take a whole lot of real estate, require fairly minimal power, and is practically a standard on smartphones. The lack of one is painfully obvious from the get-go.<br /><br />2. PS3 control. How do you include Bluetooth capability in a tablet and include an app for remote control of devices, but NOT include any functionality to be able to control the Playstation 3?!? It's a Sony tablet...and Sony dropped the ball inexplicably in this area. Granted, you can hook up a dual shock controller to the tablet so you can use the controller to play games ON the tablet...but why can't I pair the tablet to the PS3???<br /><br />3. Price/4G/Memory. At $649 ($549 for its no-frills brother) and for the size of the tablet, I can currently get a 8.9"" Kindle HDX and have 4G connectivity with 64 GB of on-board memory for only $30 more! That's just one example and it's something that's not present on the Sony. Granted, it's thinner, lighter, faster (quad-core processor)...but these are features that may likely give way to convenient data plans for some buyers. Although the quad core processor is pretty fast, I haven't seen apps (yet) where this improvement is ""wow I must get this"" factor. Or perhaps not...it depends on your needs. The Sony doesn't include 4G which is not a deal-killer for me since I typically use my phone as a hot spot anyway. However, buyer be warned and informed; there are other options in this regard and certainly at very competitive rates.<br /><br />Overall, it is a fantastic tablet...but there is definitely some room for improvement.  The kitchen bundle is a curious edition to the Xperia line-up, but many of its bundled features are offered at near-MSRP value and doesn't present much of an edge.<br /><br />Please let me know if you have any questions in the comments.",0.5111111111111111,,0.19201092372854953,,PlayStation
"We had surround sound for our livingroom, but with all the different remotes ,it got to be a touch much.Then the dvd player quit on us. So my son researched this product to see if it would meet our needs, YES IT DID. Now when the tv turns on this receiver turns on automatically.

I am not a electronics wizard by no means,that's my son's expertise.So he connected this  to our cable box, tv,and our new blue ray player and I have been very pleased.My  husband has difficulty hearing, that was the reason for the surround sound to begin with.The old system we had didn't always allow all the speakers to have words from what we were watching, only the sound from music and the effects,this receiver allows my husband to hear everything.This receiver is large, the measurements it gives are accurate,so much needed space is required.

"We travel a lot; mostly to places that we would never return.  That's the main reason we take lot's of pictures.  Although we love the pictures that result from a high-end camera, we are not willing to shlep the bulky thing around.  For the previous five years or so I have used the Cannon SD700IS, which i initially loved, but over time I became increasingly frustrated with its limited optical zoom, anti-shake and low-light sensor systems.  On two different occasions i called Cannon to ask if a new point-and-shoot existed that would give me better results; the answer was always no.  Then a friend told me about the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX9V.  i bought it, and tried it and all i can say is WOW.<br />The 16X optical zoom is amazing since it produces pictures that are as good or better than the ones i got before with a 4X zoom.  This obviously attests to the quality of the anti-shake in the Sony.  Lastly, the low-light sensor gives me pictures that are far beyond my expectation.  i did not give this camera a 5 star rating because it is heavier (193 grams) than i would have liked it to be.  However, it can easily be put into my pant or shirt pocket.  If you're looking for a quality point-and-shoot, the Sony DSC-HX9V will probably not disappoint you.",0.9333333333333333,,0.23017202096149464,,PlayStation

"First, I bought a _Sony_ TV only because I had a Sony BlueRay Home Theater that would NOT sync up with anything else; this alone was very frustrating!  My experiences with Sony Tech support will prevent me from ever buying Sony again, period.<br /><br />As to this TV - the picture is ""decent at best"".  The menu wasn't nearly as complicated as some folks are claiming and the internet features work fine, but the picture, the picture is just average.<br /><br />When objects move fast across the screen there is a 'smudge halo' that surrounds it; so thrown footballs, or fast moving cars etc look fake and warped.  The overall sharpness of the picture is also quite lacking when A-B'd next to my cheaper Phillips LED TV.  I've fiddled with the settings quite a bit with no improvement.<br /><br />The Samsung TV in this price range is a FAR better value in my opinion.

"I generally like Plasmas for their better picture quality (I already own 5 HD TVs and this is the 6th one). The only reason I decided to go with LED TV was there's no 70"" Plasma in the Market. And my 60"" looks too small in my great room - possibly because of high ceilings. After researching Sharp's 70"" TV I decided to wait for Panasonic to come up with a 70"" Plasma, but then Sony came out with this. It was decently priced, had 3D, there were no reviews. But I decided to take a chance - given Sony's reputation. I must say I am not disappointed!<br /><br />The GOOD:<br /><br />Overall Picture Quality:<br />Overall picture quality is good. I would say it is awesome given that it is not a Plasma yet Sony was able to produce brilliant blacks.<br /><br />720p Quality:<br />Picture was not pixelated with 720p output from my Verizon box. I was able to see bigger picture without any quality degradation due to bigger size. It was really surprising. The picture was at least as good as on my 60"" Plasma on 720p.<br /><br />1080p Quality:<br />I put in Avatar bluray movie and played it. I turned off all the lights to see how darks appear. Even with factory settings the result was amazing. After looking at the picture quality of this TV I can no longer argue with my friends that Plasma is superior than LED.<br /><br />3D:<br />This TV uses passive 3D!!! And this was a pleasant surprise. I like passive 3D better than active 3D for two reasons.<br />1. In passive 3D TV produces two images at a time, while each lens in your polarized 3D glasses can see only one image which feeds different images to both eyes - resulting in 3D image in your brain. I like it because instead of glasses completely blinding your each eye one after the other some 240 times a second (active 3D), your both eyes just see different images - which I have found to put less stress on your eyes and brain.<br /><br />2. Passive 3D glasses are cheap - these are the same one used in theaters. You can order around a dozen for less than 25 bucks. And they don't need to be recharged and they are light in weight. Compare that to an active 3D glass where each cost a minimum of 50 bucks and you have to recharge them and they are not as lightweight as passive.<br /><br />3D Quality:<br />Again, I restarted Avatar in 3D mode and the result was just WOW!!! My three year old daughter when walked across the TV I almost screamed that she is going to bump in the guy - but wait - the guy was in the movie. I am not kidding it happened a few times - that is when I noticed that 3D is just amazing - and it does have a pop-out effect usually experienced only in theaters. May be the screen size helped in producing life sized images.<br /><br />Now the BAD:<br /><br />Menu's are not intuitive and has a slow response time. But I wouldn't have given it 4 stars just for this reason. The reason I gave it four stars is that when changing resolution (i.e. when PlayStation goes from playing bluray video to home screen and back) the screen goes blank and TV stops responding to commands. I could still hear the sound but no picture. I have to turn it off and back on and I start to see the picture. This is most likely a manufacturing defect. I still have to contact Sony about it (as I just got TV last night). Will update the review when I have this resolved.<br /><br />Tip:<br /><br />I had my PlayStation connected with an old HDMI cable which worked fine with my old TV. When I connected PlayStation to the new TV with the same cable I was able to see the menus and stuff. However when I try to play a 3D movie the picture would go blank and I would hear sound after long pauses. I remembered reading somewhere that 3D requires newer faster HDMI cables. I had some newer HDMI cables in my stash. So when I changed it everything started working. So if you are unable to play 3D movies try a newer (I think ver 1.4 is required but I am not sure - just google it) HDMI cable.<br /><br />EDIT 5/7/2013:<br /><br />My issue above was resolved by a call to tech support. I had to unplug both TV and Playstation while they were ""on"". Then disconnect the HDMI cable, wait for one minute and then plug TV and Playstation back in. Connect the HDMI cable. This resolved the issue above - so I updated my rating to 5 star!",0.8444444444444444,,0.18358223089099962,,PlayStation

"As of this writing I have owned this camera for only two days. With decades of experience and a huge investment in pro photo equipment I'm not exactly a newbie. I find this camera to be remarkable in its class. Of course it can't compete optically with bodies and lenses costing 10X as much as this complete outfit, but for a pocketable item it knocks the socks off of even the best cell phone cameras. That is exactly why I bought it.<br /><br />There are lots of features and functions I have not yet tried, but one thing I can complain about is the awkward interface to my PC. It seems that images and video stored on the memory card are in a file format that cannot be simply transferred to the PC by removing the card from the camera and inserting it into a card reader on the PC. To get your work into your PC requires installation of SONY's proprietary PMB software that is supplied on a CD with the camera. You would think that once PMB is installed that should be the end of the matter right? Wrong! Next you have to get PMB to recognize your camera - and the connection must be made in a very specific sequence of starting the software, turning on the camera, and then attaching the USB cable. Do it the wrong way and PMB won't see your camera although it will bring up other photo/video folders you may have on your hard drive(s).<br /><br />Another frustration is AUTORUN on my PC. As soon as I plug in the camera, other photo/video applications (in my case that is Windows Live Movie Maker and Canon's special software) pop up immediately and they must all be closed or PMB will not run. Unfortunately the PMB warning to shut down those other applications will not let you X them off unless you first X off the PMB warning screen. Once you do that you have to start all over by shutting off the camera and unplugging the USB cable etc. Frustrating to say the least. Once you have crossed all the t's and dotted all the i's in the correct sequence, PMB does recognize the camera and you can import video into your PC - in a low resolution preview mode. Next, PMB must convert it to HD as you originally intended. That process can take as long as the real time video takes to run. Apparently the remarkable shooting speed in the camera is thanks to some clever compression algorithms that must be decompressed before viewing later.<br /><br />Apparently PMB software is strictly for the PC. It cannot be installed on the Mac, nor is it needed. iPhoto on the Mac immediately recognizes photos, displays and downloads them if you wish. For video I use Roxio's Toast 11 Titanium. Grabs video directly off the camera and allows you to edit if you wish and burn directly to CD/DVD/Blu Ray, or whatever you have.",0.9333333333333333,,0.04227346727346727,,PlayStation
"I picked Sony STRDH520 mainly to pair with Sony Bravia TV in the my home theater system. The speakers are Polk TSi400, TSi100, CS10, and PSW10. I was first a little concerned about the power of STDDH520, but was impressed by the strong sound stage and acoustic presence right after I tested a couple of discs, including the Phantom of the Opera and Bocelli Live In Tuscany. It may not be as robust as some of the more expensive models, but is good enough for the setup I have.<br /><br />Update (March 4, 2013): The plastic clip to hold one of the surround speaker wire came loose and the little metal spring inside sprang out. I tried to put it back, but the clip simply wouldn't stay tight anymore. I contacted the local Sony service provider and they said it wasn't covered by the warranty.

"I bought this to replace a Panasonic Lumix DSC-TZ3 that had provided several years of great images and dependability. I planned that my next camera would also be a Lumix, but current reviews put other competitors ahead of any comparable Panasonic. I found this Sony at the top in many reviews,  and in price-checking, got an extraordinary deal at the country's best-known electronics brick-and-mortar retailer for under two-hundred bucks. A week later, it was taking photos in Cancun and Merida, Mexico.<br /><br />This is a great compact camera.  It has an amazing suite of internal programs that makes it almost impossible not to get a good exposure. It's a little eerie to experience the camera in burst mode while taking ""regular"" shots -- it's the auto-bracketing feature to insure a good exposure in difficult lighting, and it does the same for other situations such as back-lighting. On the recent night in early May with the closest moon of the year, I hand-held the camera on a roof terrace as the full-moon emerged from clouds. The camera did it's burst thing, and the results are as sharp as a tripod-mounted shot. Amazing. Then, while the moon was fully obscured by clouds - and the sky was nearly black - I took more shots. The night sky became something from a science-fiction movie . . . the clouds are fully outlined with the moonlight breaking through and around them like sunlight!  The background color is a deep blue with white-gold highlights of the moonlight's rays and highlights. It's automatic Van Gough surrealism! Of course, you control this camera, so you don't have to let it produce such drama.<br /><br />For a mega-zoom compact camera, it's as easy to carry in my front pants pocket as its Lumix predecessor -- for travel, that's critical for a compact camera, otherwise, why not carry a DSLR?<br /><br />I tested almost every feature of this camera, and several do things I've never had access to on any camera: 3D (well, my cellphone does take 3D photos and videos), sweep panorama, 1080p video at 30fps, incredible stabilization, background blur, GPS, etc., etc. At least one Amazon reviewer has commented that the image quality isn't great. I don'tknow what he's using for reference, but I'm getting great results in a wide variety of conditions. Sometimes, I do have to disable some of the programmed settings and get back to basics to capture what I'm seeing in some settings such as interior lighting. But, overall, it's a learning experience like most technology, and it's worth the effort for the things this camera can do. One thing about zoom range of compact cameras -- there are competing models with more zoom power, but there's a limit of the ability of the small objective lens on compact cameras to produce sharpness and clarity over great distances. Atmospheric conditions such as heat waves will render maximum power shots at great distance not that satisfactorily. This camera is at that limit at 16x, and the additional power (20x) coming with other similar compacts can't be that effective in a usable image, at least for distance telephoto. One final note, the LCD screen renders higher color saturation than you'll see in prints or a monitor.  It's helpful to review shots, especially on bright days, but don't let that mislead what you're actually capturing.",0.9333333333333333,,0.1745138888888889,,PlayStation
This camera does a lot more than I thought it would.  The picture quality seems very good.  The zoom and image stabilization are very good and the large display screen is terrific for reviewing photos or showing them to people.  The automatic features work well but it takes some time to learn how to use them.  The video works incredibly well for a small camera.  What I most appreciate is the optical zoom.  It brings in distance features very close with high detail.  The camera is well worth the money.

"My brand new Sony KDL46BX420 is about 10 hours old and after 48 minutes on the phone with a clueless Sony ""technician"", it has been declared officially ""in need of repair."" It has not worked for a single minute. Will Sony replace it? No. Will Sony send a repairman? (Are there still TV repairmen?) No. Sony will give me a telephone number. I am supposed to call, set up an appointment and, if I'm lucky, just take a single day off work waiting and praying for him to show up.<br /><br />This is the third Sony in my house (the other two work great, thanks) but the first two were made years ago when Sony cared about quality and still topped the charts in Consumer Reports. No more.<br /><br />I had done a lot of research and knew the BX-line was the bottom of the line for Sony, but I didn't want 3D or ""motion flow"" or internet connectivity. I just wanted a good, solid TV.<br /><br />Forget it. This TV screams ""cheap."" It is made entirely of shiny, black plastic that reflects every light in the room. And, oh yeah, it doesn't work.<br /><br />I will revisit this review if/when the set gets fixed, but as for now I would avoid the BX-line.<br /><br />Or, better yet, avoid Sony and try a Samsung. I sure will next time.<br /><br />UPDATE TO REVIEW, June 9, 2011:<br />Well, the repairman just left and after he fiddled with the controls a little - - admitting that he wasn't sure what each one did - - he said the best he could do was get me a ""decent"" picture and poor sound. He also said that it was clear the Sony technician didn't know what he was doing and that it was best to always call Sony during regular business hours in order to get a technician in this hemisphere.<br /><br />""If I were you, I would get an LG next time,"" he said. ""They are really good.""<br /><br />Good to know for ""next time."" No more Sonys for me.",0.911111111111111,,0.20630411255411255,,PlayStation
"This is certainly a great receiver if you need something to handle a TV and a couple of other devices. Sound quality is great for modest speaker setups, and the Dolby decoder does an excellent job. However, it's lacking in inputs and doesn't have much flexibility for multiple non-HDMI devices. For the price, this is to be expected and it won't be a problem for most people. But since I didn't see these things mentioned in previous reviews, I'll list them here:<br /><br />* Component inputs will not be converted and passed through to HDMI to the TV. If you use component inputs, you need another component cable running to the TV. I know, no big surprise, no other receivers at this price point will do that either.<br /><br />* No phono/pre-amp input. Again, not a big deal, if you're one of the few people that still uses a turntable (like me), you'll need to buy a separate pre-amp.<br /><br />* A maximum of 4 video-capable devices can be plugged into this receiver. Practically speaking, at least two of those will have to be HDMI if you want to fully utilize this box. Component and analog inputs are extremely limited. If you don't have a mostly HDMI setup, I would recommend searching for a PDF of the owner's manual before buying this receiver to make sure that all of your devices can be plugged in.<br /><br />* Fortunately, you can reassign inputs based on your needs, BUT this is limited as well. For instance, you cannot assign any of the composite (yellow) video inputs to the BD/DVD mode. The only modes that can handle both analog video and sound inputs are ""VIDEO"" and ""SAT/CATV"". Another cost-saving measure by Sony.<br /><br />* Only one optical audio input can be used. The second one is for TVs without the HDMI audio return channel capability. If your TV supports HDMI 1.4, then that optical input will probably stay unused forever. It cannot be reassigned to a second device with optical support.",0.911111111111111,,0.17140652557319228,,PlayStation

"Sony's 46"" LCD TV with 1080p high definition is my choice after trying the Samsung 46"" 1080p LCD.  I do not watch everything in high def native 1080p.  Programs like ESPN, ESPN2, CNN, MSNBC are in standard def but these stations broadcast with an info bar at the bottom of the screen.  The Sony Bravia engine can present these channels in Wide Zoom mode maintaining a good aspect ratio and display the info bar at the bottom.  The Samsung 46"" 1080p can not.  Their Wide Zoom mode tries to keep the aspect ratio as broadcast which leads to cutting off the top and the bottom.  Very annoying.  If you move the image up to read the info bar you chop off the announcers head.  While the Samsung with black screen offered a slightly better picture contrast with deep blacks, the Sony simply is a better TV because it handles standard broadcasts better, you can see the whole picture in Wide Zoom mode, the picture clarity is wonderful, the speakers in the TV are much, much better than the Samsung and the price was a little lower for the Sony.  The screen is fast so I do not need the 120 or now 240 fast processing.  When I tried it on the Samsung I could not tell the difference.  I think 120 per sec. frame processing is close to ""gimmick"" and typical marketing to get us to buy the latest version.",0.8888888888888888,,0.11108024691358026,,PlayStation
"I bought this TV to replace a Vizio 47 inch. This is an excellent tv, not without some faults, but still 5 stars in my opinion! First the good: picture quality is excellent, this tv has the extras I like - Amazon, Netflix both stream with no issues and a number of others I have not really tried out yet. It was very easy to set up and I can now just have one HDMI cable going from my receiver to the tv! About HDMI cables, make sure you get the latest high speed 1.4 cables (Amazons worked fine). I had another brand and the 3D did not work properly, kept cutting out. The 3D is in a word amazing! I was watching Alice in Wonderland with my son who saw it in 3D at the IMAX and he said it was as good! He also said the Sony glasses were much better than at the IMAX too, but then they should be for $140. a piece! The tv looks great, very slim and designed very well. The remote works well and controls my other devices. The not so good: Does not have built in wifi, but I knew that when I bought it. Does not allow you to force a firmware update, you either have to download it to a thumb drive and install it or wait for the tv to update itself (within 24 hrs according to tech support). But when netflix wouldn't work I opted to download and install, which worked with no problems. The speakers as others have said are not the best, but I don't think any tv speaker is that good and this is as good as any other tv I have owned. The bottom line, this is an excellent 3D tv and lives up to my expectations!",0.7555555555555555,,0.45118589743589743,,PlayStation

"I just wanted to post a review with the words &#34;blacker than a Haggunenon's battle cruiser&#34; in the headline.<br /><br />Now I can die a happy man.<br /><br />Seriously, the picture and black levels are flawless and worth the money, IMHO.  My 5 stars is based solely on picture quality, resolution and adjustment options.  Many users may opt to disable or lower motion smoothing settings to get that 24fps feel in movies.<br /><br />The apps are bit confusing.  The amount and location of apps feels odd.  I ran YouTube from the home screen and activated it.  Later I was playing with Android TV by going into the Android TV menu from settings and saw YouTube in the list of apps.  I expected it to be activated but it wasn't.  This leads to some confusion.  Is Android TV separate from the Apps on the home screen or did I encounter a bug?  I thought the whole thing was running Android TV?<br /><br />I never did try to reproduce the issue.  It was simpler for me to plug my Roku back in and leave the Sony disconnected from the network.  I occasionally get an HDCP error but have a new 4K 60Hz HDMI cable on the way.<br /><br />I'll definitely try it again as I have plans to try to side load at least one app for 'extra curricular' viewing.  The app in mind is poorly supported on Roku but acceptable on Andoid.<br /><br />I tested Bluetooth with my noise cancelling headset.  It connected on the 2nd try.  I can even turn off the picture without disabling sound.  This is brilliant on those nights that my wife or myself just want silence or darkness.<br /><br />My soundbar doesn't do HDMI 2.2 but it does work well with the optical out cable.  This too works with the picture off.  No upgrade required.<br /><br />Miracast sucks.  It starts to connect and times out (this is with WIFI enabled and yes, I can see the device).  On my Roku Miracast performs marginally better, connecting for 5-60 seconds before disconnecting.  It could be my POS phone.<br /><br />That's all for now folks.",0.8888888888888888,,0.1365013774104683,,PlayStation

"I have had this Sony for almost seven months and am still happy with it.  So far have not adjusted anything.  The only problem I have had so far was that I lost the sound and had to reset my cable box and turn the Sony back on.  However, if you are considering this model I have a suggestion you should seriously consider, which I will leave until the end.  Note that this model is probably discontinued, so the issue is academic anyway as the XBR7/8 replaces it.<br /><br />Pros:  Picture on HD and Blu-rays is always good.  Picture on DVDs up converted by blu ray player is also good.  HDMI connections are very convenient (buy the Belkin HDMI Gold connectors from Amazon and save yourself a big box rip-off!).  Most SD pictures are fine on the Sony Bravia XBR6.<br /><br />Cons:  Sound is a little thin.  Menu response is slow.  This unit is not thin by any stretch of the imagination and it produces a lot of heat.<br /><br />Summary: all around performance that is easy to live with.  A sure thing.<br />However, I recommend that you spend the extra $350 and move up to the 40 inch, that is unless you are really tight for space.  This is for two reasons:<br /><br />  1) 37 inch is not that big when you are viewing SD pictures.  It is also not that big if you are watching converted video and the top or sides are cut off.<br /><br />  2) The true XBR enhancements are featured on the 40 inch and above series XBRs.  The smaller ones have the enhanced contrast and resolution, but the full feature set kicks in with the bigger models.

The HDMI slots after a year or so seem to get a little rough with the connections and sometimes doesn't register components or they get static, and if I re-insert the cables it works fine.<br /><br />A HUGE drawback of this unit is the lack of an on-screen display. Making adjustments to it are a nightmare while squinting to read the led panel and maintain a good distance for adjusting sound. Why Sony didn't think this through is beyond me.<br /><br />Some other minor things are input variety, RCA inputs are very limited and don't work well...ideally HDMI is the only way to go using this.",0.8444444444444444,,0.19538690476190476,,PlayStation

"I received the Sony 55"" tv in perfect condition.  I am not very tech savvy but I was able to set it up and program it for wireless fairly easily. There are a few codes needed and I had to go back and forth between my computer and tv to get the codes and enter them into the tv.  I do not plan on using the 3D option so I have no feedback regarding that feature.  The picture is fantastic.  I was a bit skeptical about the Corning Gorilla Glass with Opticontrast for reducing glare.  The tv faces a large window and although it is far better than our last tv regarding glare, I was hoping for even better glare reduction.  The Netflix streaming works great! It's better than on my home pc! I have already watched a few movies via wireless Netflix with absolutely no problems.  I tried Pandora and Facebook briefly and those seem to be just fine as well.  There are several other apps/widgets that a person can peruse through but I'm sure I won't ever use most of them.  I'm extremely happy with the picture and the functions.  The remote control is user friendly enough, except when you want to type something in such as on Facebook or setting up weather stations, it takes a while as expected without a true keyboard.

"We have always had great luck with Sony‚Äôs tvs, going back to our first Trinitron model.  Not one of them has ever stopped working or needed repair and we wound up giving them away when moving or upgrading models.<br /><br />Eighteen months ago I purchased my first 4k tv, a Sony XBR49X830C 49-Inch.  I love that tv and found that the 49 inch, thirty pound model is perfect for us.  I wanted the same tv for another room but decided to upgrade to the 900 series.  This 49 inch model is the only one of that size available in this series.<br /><br />I was really interested to see if there would be a noticeable difference in the two model lines which differ by a few hundred dollars.  The first major difference I found just by taking it out of the box.  The 830C has a regular plug while this 900E has a large nine inch long power adapter with the DC plug in port on the side of the tv.<br /><br />The remote is slightly upgraded too by including a voice option in it but I am so used to using the buttons on the old remote that I rarely use speech.  Both this tv and the 830C have the same Android options and both coordinate beautifully with google home and the built in chromecast.  Other apps like Amazon video and Netflix are also built in options but others are available from the play store.<br /><br />I had really noticed the improved picture quality when upgrading from 1080 to the 4K on the 830C model and wondered if I would be as impressed with the improvements on the 900E.  I am.  To me the picture quality is the most important consideration. This picture is flawless whether I am streaming video or using the built in tuner for OTA tv viewing.

"All I can say it that I have been reviewing LED TVs for well over 6 months just waiting to buy one.  I finally bought the Sony 46"" LED EX645 and all I can say is wow.  I did not want 3-D and was looking for the best picture I could find with at least 120Hz Motion Flow.  This one has 240!  I saw this in person at the SONY store and the picture quality was awesome.  I bought the TV and got it home.  15 minutes to get the base attached and it was up and running.  Easy setup and it connected to my WiFi immediately.  Not one hitch up.

We do have a 52"" SONY LCD in the basement and the picture is awesome as well, but this LED even blows that away.  We cannot be happier.  I would buy this again in a heartbeat.  Remember, you are buying this for the picture, not the sound.  We hooked a up a DELL 2.1 computer speaker system to the back through the mini-stereo jack and the sound is amazing now.  It is not 5.1, but sounds great.  The sound itself on the TV is okay, but ok at best.  The DELL system was $40 and sounds incredible with this TV.  The 4 HDMI were also a major selling point.

"We were looking to replace our Sony H55, which took great pictures but somehow the ""review"" button broke after the warranties elapsed. Shocking, no?  Anyway, we asked around, read reviews, watched CNET, etc., and the choices came down to a Nikon 9100 or the Sony HX9V.  Because the Nikon was (at the time) $70 cheaper and we had the button issue with the H55, we went with the Nikon.  That was a terrible choice.  We played with it for 3 days, and for every ""decent to good"" picture you took (great seemed like a pipe dream), you took 5 terrible shots.  It was jittery, it had issues with focal points, lighting...everything about it sucked.  We're pretty good photographers, so it was very frustrating and surprising.  We returned it and ordered the Sony.  In the week that passed, the Sony dropped $35, which was a pleasant surprise.  It came 2 days later, and it's been a dream ever since.  Portraits, back light, low light, full zoom, action, pets, aquarium...every picture, every setting, it's been awesome.  The auto scene selector just works, and there's very little you need to do in fiddling with it.  Just turn it on and go.  We haven't tried any video yet, so I can't comment on that.  One thing to be careful about, though, are batteries.  We bought it with the expectation of reusing our H55 batteries, because the H55 and the HX9V use the same battery.  However, the HX9V said the Delkin (decent brand, not a $3 knock-off) batteries we had weren't compatible.  That statement actually appeared on the LCD.  So, we're using the Sony battery that came with the H55 (that works, so I know it's not a form factor or voltage issue) and the Sony battery that came with the HX9V.  The Delkins are going to operate the H55, which we'll let the kids use.  We also bought a 3 year warranty because ""fool me once...""",0.9333333333333333,,0.12489850427350427,,PlayStation

"Here's a simple statement.  A local high-end A/V outfitter recommended this tv to me, their basic synopsis was; this ""W"" series is basically the best tv sold without 4K and without the 4K price tag.  It's the same other than that and they were spot on.  I walked in looking at 65"" Samsung 7100 to upgrade our 50"" Panasonic plasma which was too glossy in our new house family room.  I am spoiled with the plasma but it didn't take long to realize I had a true contender/replacement.  Amazing picture.  Sound isn't bad either for such a small frame.<br /><br />I was a little concerned about such an expensive purchase ""online"".  With the enhanced delivery process and even the expertise of the delivery man I'm not sure why I haven't done this sooner.  Pricing was essentially the same on amazon as in local stores but I will never again think twice about a large tv purchase on amazon.  Great transaction, and they unpacked stating outside temp was too low to turn the unit on to test, so he stated on his paperwork that he was unable to test making it that much easier to process a return if something wasn't right.  All was perfect.",0.8444444444444444,,0.08358150470219436,,PlayStation
"I bought this TV on May 28th from CC. So far I am completely satisfied with the TV. It has the legendry Sony Picture quality Tag and it truly delivers upto its name. Lots of reviewers talk about the Sound Quality but I foud that it is way better than other Samsung and LG/Sharp. The S Surround sound is exceptional. Though it should not be compared to any HT system quality.<br /><br />4 HDMI connection rocks and if you have Bravia Sync components you dont even need an extra remote. I have hooked up my Sony DVD player, Onkoyo HT system and Cable receiver via HDMI. This TV has more than enough HD inputs which comes very handy if you wanna hoke up all the appliances together. One more feature is the TV and Text mode when I hook up my Sony Vaio. It delivers a crisp quality picture. The new V Series looks better than its predecessors and you cant get a better TV with a price tag of 1350.",0.8,,0.32400178253119427,,PlayStation

"We finally got a new TV to replace our 25"" Sony Wega, which had a wonderful, though analog, picture.  This TV arrived perfectly on time, was set up in just a few minutes, and we have been dazzled by it.  Best of all, it picked up all the HD channels on our basic cable feed, which we didn't expect.  Thought we'd have to upgrade that too, but are very happy, since it's only 55 bucks a month.  We haven't used it as a computer yet, because we have a new PC in the same room.  After a month, we are still dazzled by it.  Also has quick channel changing, very easy to use features and a GREAT picture, gloriously sharp and clear.

"This is just an average tv.. of course you knew that because you spent &lt; $1500 on the set. So even though, the features are nothing to write home about and you'll find the same in equivalent tv.<br /><br />So here are my pet peeves, you might be fine with them:<br />1) Multiple ways to get to the menu.<br />2) Apps are separated into two: Yahoo store and Sony Entertainment Network app. I want everything on one store.<br />3) Multiple menu level.<br />4) Remote is non-intuitive.. why is it so hard to put a darn keyboard there!<br />5) No Vudu support: the internal replacement app provided works just fine.<br /><br />I'm going to keep the TV.. because I don't think that I'll be using it too much and it suits just fine for my needs.. but here's my advice to Sony:<br /><br />1) Work on the usability aspect much more.. get rid of the colored buttons.<br />2) Have uniform interface.<br />3) Abstract store interface, people watching tv don't care if it they are getting stuff from google store or yahoo store or S.E.N.. just make it work.<br />4) Ability to customize the menus from a webapp of some sort.",0.7555555555555555,,0.07430555555555556,,PlayStation
"Ok, I'm writing this review based on a few things:  1.  Having done extensive research on this product and on 4k televisions in general.  2.  Seeing the Demo unit at the store and watching it for what seemed like an hour (on a couple of visits) and most importantly... 3.  Having a very close friend purchase one and spend a boatload of cash to be the first of our group to have one.  So here are my thoughts:<br /><br />It is a Good television.  1080p broadcast over a cable box, or a 1080p blu ray look as good as on just about any other tv.  Not necessarily better than on other TVs but they look good.  4k content looks very good...but here is the deal.  If you are sitting 8 feet more more away, I cannot tell ANY difference between this and a 1080p set.  If you are 6-8 feet away, I THINK I can tell a difference, but I'm not sure (I'm not sure if I think there is a difference but am trying to convince myself there is one)  In all reality, you really have to be standing (or sitting) right up close to the TV to tell a difference for sure.<br /><br />Now here is the problem with that (at least for me). Sure, this would be great for most people in a huge set (80 inches plus) or to enjoy a 60 incher 4k tv from just a few feet away. BUT, when I sit that close, I find I don't enjoy watching the TV that much.  After a little while, I find my eyes are having to move around too much to catch details on the screen that are happing on the far left or right.  If you think it sounds silly, try watching a sporting event or a movie on your current set from just 2 feet away, it is fatiguing to your eyes, not from the strain of the light, but from how much you have to move around to watch things.  So personally, I find watching television and moves most enjoyable when I am, say, at least 6 feet away from a 50 inch screen, or 8 feet from a 60 inch screen. And at that distance, there really isn't much of a differene between 4k content and 1080p content.<br /><br />So overall, the set is a good set, but it is really only an improvement from distances or from a set so big that make it 'uncomfortable' to watch for extended periods of time.",0.6888888888888889,,0.17926384839650145,,PlayStation
"PROS:<br /><br />Rich blacks and whites.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />For the first HOUR you turn your set on it makes snap, crackle and pop noises as the components adjust to warming up.<br />AND it does it for an hour after you turn it off!!  Its insane.  Clearly they were in such a rush to come up with make a super<br />thin screen that they forgot to properly test it.<br /><br />Also the speaker set-up is horrible.  They are literally behind the set or facing down - which makes for terrible acoustics.<br />You need to max the volume to get any quality sound.<br /><br />Finally the edge led is far from perfected.  Back-lit is still miles above.<br /><br />Avoid this set until they work out the bugs!",0.6666666666666666,,-0.29399305555555555,,PlayStation

"This is an amazing tv. Let me put this into the context of my situation. I recently bought the sony x930c, their best 65 inch 4k model from 2015. I returned it. While 4k content is stunning, signal from verizon fios at 720p or 1080i looks unsharp and grainy due to up conversion. 99%+ of what i watch is tv. Why spend 2 grand on a tv that looks worse than my 8 year old kds60a3000?!<br /><br />Enter amazon reviews and some helpful peope on avsforum. This tv is simply gorgeous. Blacks are deep and dark. I dont notice a difference from plasma or even from my limited experience with oled. The colors are so vibrant but not oversaturated. I bought this tv used, having never even seen this model in person. I took a leap of faith based on the amazon, crutchfield, and various other reviews. I also noted that these basically never go up for sale on ebay, meaning those who have this set keep it.<br /><br />I havent done much with 3d other than verify that it works, but it looked great.<br /><br />Video games are perfect on this tv with its 17-19ms response time.<br /><br />If you can find this, buy it.

"I am Pioneer amp type but after owning 4x them, I wanted to move up to TrueHD and some other perks. This unit has everything I need and more. I did order two additional SONY 2-way speakers they're so cheap here on Amazon you get pair for the one price. Now I have 6x of those here for this unit. 7.1 channel adds additional pair of speakers. In all I have everything hooked up. HDTV from SONY 46"" that had 4x HDMI since this DH520 has 4x HDTV switching was quick. I use the entire setup here with Harmony 700 which I setup Comcast HD STB, SONY BD, SONY Network Media Player, all to the DH520 no issues. Switching from the Harmony 700 to the everything goes on for CATV viewing, WLAN Viewing and B-Ray Viewing. There is also OSD from this unit you need a SONY BRAVIA HDTV for that feature. In all it works. I don't see why some of you having issues with this model. Sound is excellent! So excellent I am returning STR-DH510 from Walmart the price to change it only $25 difference and what you get with the STR-DH520 is a better value here. Also Amazon price beats Walmart hands down. I had to pay for shipping it directly to me and tax. Still from Amazon no tax and I am prime so that make shipping faster. In all STR-DH520 is much better than the STR-DH510. You get some much more audio surround features extra HDMI port, extra surround amp for 7.1 so it's 700 watts or you can use it as 5.1 for your 500 watts. This one supports 3D and 24p you need that for true cinema experience where as the STR-DH510 doesn't support 3D but it does do 24p but only DTS, Dolby Pro Logic II not the newer one nor does it no do TrueHD. Well anyway the higher models to this one 720 basically the same except is has small amp boost, and the 820 has few perks but the price and this one here just a better deal..<br /><br />If your want something better get the STR-DH520 at this price while you can!",0.911111111111111,,0.2594907407407407,,PlayStation

"Oh man, I bought this for my son for his birthday, after he was jealous of his brother having a tv that actually worked in his room.  We have been looking to cut the cable cord for awhile, & have been trying to figure out media streamers, roku, fire tv, & all the rest.  I actually wrote to Amazon for some help on choosing a fire stick or tv device, as we have kindles, & prime, & thought we'd stick with amazon, because we'd been satisfied.  No one ever wrote back to me, & my husband & I were reading so much about different streamers, & unsure what would work in his room since we could not do cable in there, & we have an older tv with RCA plugs.  So when it showed, I wanted to set it up with our wifi password, & see if it all worked, before wrapping it.  It is so cool!  My husband had bought an HDMI cord, and an adaptor from radio shack to connect an hdmi cord to an hdmi out port (which we were very unsure if that would work, since we had read about needing a converter box).  But it worked, & it works fantastically!  At first, it started doing some weird skipping thing, & I hoped it'd be something simple.  But we couldn't figure out why, so we were going to box it back up (it's refurbished), but decided to try it on our tv, & it worked beautifully.  Wifi worked great, signed into Amazon, youtube, no problems!  Love it!  Thought we might be keeping it for ourselves ;) but my husband for some reason thought to try it one more time in my son's room, & though I have absolutely no idea why, but it has been working ever since.  My husband told me it briefly flashed for a bit, but then stopped altogether, & now is running smoothly.  I signed up a playstation account, netflix, hulu, but didn't realize that all free trials require a credit card, & after being charged monthly after free trials of various things, such as audible, esalon, other places after cancelling our subscriptions, we aren't taking the chances anymore.  Audible told us that it's just because people always forget to cancel, but of course, it's not the case (for many people, I'm assuming), & they actually somehow charged both of the credit cards on our family prime account for audible, 2x a month, & no refund for at least one card?  So, since we're hoping to cut the $200 cable company bill, a lot of the apps are useless wastes of money for us, which I was surprised about (I thought there would be more free apps, I thought I had read the radio app was free at least), but so far, we have only found youtube to be free, & we can use our amazon prime account.  So with that, & if I can find out some more free apps, we can cut the cable cord, as well as watch dvds again!  I'm just about ready to cut cable!

"I bought this Sony receiver to replace a Onkyo costing more than twice as much money. It more than adequately drives my Polk Audio floor speakers and Klipsch subwoofer. Although it doesn't have a second zone (that received no use on my Onkyo) it receives radio stations much better than my previous receiver. It connects nicely with my PS3 and Sony multi-CD player used for audio playback. The unit has a 1080p standby/pass-through mode that supports 3D TV, and I used the 'fiber out' from the TV to the Sony to cover all amp options for great sound. The Onkyo had a channel balancing microphone to dial in speaker levels; apparently Sony only provides this on European models(?). Accessing controls to balance side channels--but more importantly the center channel for watching movies--was not a very intuitive experience. When playing music, the amp cuts out the center channel and subwoofer, I appreciate the loss center channel but rewired side speakers through subwoofer to keep the deep-throbbing in place for rock and roll.  Although the Onkyo is a very good receiver,  I would recommend this amp to anyone looking for a good, solid receiver at half the price but willing to invest extra time in setup and balancing to meet your needs.

"I posted a review on the Denon AVR-1713 which is a quick comparison between it and this Sony here. I'm just copying that review here so that you can see why this receiver only gets a 3-star.<br /><br />""I won't be writing a detail review but just want to say this product works as it is designed, unlike another brand (Sony STRDH520) I tried. On the Denon, HDMI switching, pass-through, etc... works 100% whereas the Sony would have lots of issues with audio dropping, random lost of signal upon powering off and on devices (for some reason, it needs to be on and ready before all other HDMI devices), unable to pass-through audio to TV without setting the AMP to TV+AMP mode; but in this state, all audio formats are LPCM for both the TV and the AMP. The Denon knows how to send 2ch audio to the TV and HD audio will remain on the AMP.  For analog inputs, both units work as advertised.

Yes, it is twice as much as the Sony but in the end, would you rather have a fully working or semi working unit?""<br /><br />In this age, HDMI features are very important. Unfortunately, Sony can only deliver a flaky presentation. I have 2 Sony receivers (pre-HDMI and still running). They perform exactly as they are supposed to and long lasting as well.

"I bought this camera for a combination of reasons, and it's lived up to expectations on all counts:<br /><br /> - Portability.  I knew, as a casual photographer, I wouldn't carry a DSLR around.  This isn't as convenient as a cell phone camera or a really small 3x zoom camera, but it's still easy enough to take in a pocket, and much better quality.<br /> - Night photos.  This camera can take some amazing photos at night, including from a distance.  Take a look at some pictures on review sites.  In the end, this was the deciding factor for me, since I take a fair amount of my photos outdoor at night, and it's been a good choice.<br /> - Zoom.  I wouldn't want to go back to a 3 or 5x zoom camera after using this one.<br /><br />The only downsides I've noticed is that it isn't the quickest camera to turn on, and the flash pops up in the upper-left, where it would be natural to hold the camera when taking a picture.  But these are pretty minor.",0.9333333333333333,,0.19102564102564107,,PlayStation
"I have had quite the history with this television. To summarize I ordered the first set initially from Amazon, had Pilot deliver it a week later (after missing three promised delivery dates in the process) and finally set it up. I was able to enjoy it for less than 48 hours before it developed a propensity to shut off after about 30 seconds of use multiple times, then give me the &#34;LED flashes 8 times&#34; code. Looking on the internet, another person had the same issue and attributed it to a faulty power supply, which made sense based on the symptoms.<br /><br />After a useless call to Sony, I called Amazon who came through with sending me a replacement tv. On the scheduled delivery date of my second set, good ol' Pilot actually had no idea where the television was. They had to call all of their ports and finally located the tv sitting on a dock in Ohio. Needless to say the second set again was delayed by about 5 days. Apparently these large-item shipping delays &#34;rarely happen&#34; but it occurred to me twice in a month. Go figure. At least after being quite vocal about this whole ordeal (squeaky wheels get the grease, right?), I got a 10% refund, which for this tv is a huge deal.<br /><br />Anyway, the television looks incredible. Of course, my previous television was a 40&#34; rear-projection LCD Sony from 2005, which admittedly would make any $150 flat panel tv from Walmart look like a 4k in comparison, but seriously this television is a work of art hanging on the wall. The colors are rich with great clarity, and this is using standard 1080p signals from satellite or Blu-Ray--not even touching the true capabilities of what this set can do. The speakers actually face forward as well, so the sound is much better than other televisions which have rear-facing speakers.<br /><br />Needless to say, this is an amazing television in my opinion, as long as it keeps working!",0.6888888888888889,,0.12977756892230574,,PlayStation
"The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX9V is everything I expected it to be and much more. I'm learning more and more about it with every use. It has a built-in icon guide that will tell you what the icons mean that appear on the LCD screen. But if you want to find out the ""old-school"" way -- which I'm not always opposed to -- is by reading the icon guide in the manual that comes with the product.<br /><br />This camera captures crisp images. The grass is greener and the sky and water are bluer (a deep, rich sapphire color). I would definitely recommend this to another, whom of course has this much to spend on a camera. I wouldn't, though, recommend this to a novice photographer but to more of a casual photographer or to someone who knows a bit more about cameras than I do.

"I bought this on July 29th for a family vacation. I have to say that it performed flawlessly during the vacation. However, within a month of buying it I noticed the flash wouldn't work. I thought it was just me not knowing how to work the camera. After spending an hour tooling through the online manual i discovered that it wasn't in fact user error but that the flash had failed.<br /><br />Unfortunately I bought it at Best Buy but fortunately I bought the service policy (I never buy those things but since I had had Sony failures in the past I opted for it). Best Buy sucks and is a terrible time sucker. Today when i went to pick it up the servicer had practically destroyed the camera. After about an hour of pitching a fit I got a new camera and a new warranty.<br /><br />This is a great little camera when it is working.

So as a student who always believed a camera phone was sufficient getting this camera was unbelievable.

Comparing pictures with this to my 8mp iPhone is ridiculous. There is not any competition what so ever. You can even tell by the thumbnails which camera took which there is such a difference.

"I'd been looking for a good travel zoom camera for taking on vacation when I don't want to lug around my larger camera kit. After a lot of research, I'd narrowed it down to the Panasonic TZ10 and the HX9V. What sold me on the HX9V were all the great, extra features like HDR, excellent sweep panorama and the multi-shot modes where multiple photos are merged into a single resulting shot.<br /><br />Having used the camera for a few months, we're quite happy with it. The pictures are sharp, it focuses very quickly, the HDR works very well and we're still discovering new capabilities of this camera.<br /><br />If I had to name a drawback, the main one would be that the variety of modes can be quite confusing, and there's very little documentation (what exists is pretty much all in-camera). However, if you're willing to play around and enjoy discovering how these modes work (like I do), it's a lot of fun.

"There are three great reasons to get this camera.<br />1. As your sole camera.<br />2. As your sole video camera.<br />3. As a backup to your dslr<br /><br />As your sole camera this has a lot of advantages. It's small, light portable; ok so is every Point and Shoot (PAS), and even my phone. But this one has a mega zoom range and not just an unusable. If it started at 28mm equivalent it would be ok, that's my personal minimum I'd never buy a cam without at least 28mm but I love the 24mm equiv that this has. With all the camping/hiking I do the extra wide is very noticeable and worth it. Also for indoor and large group shots it's also needed. Then the zoom up to a 384mm is great. Honestly anything over 300 is silly without a tripod. Still the image stabilization (IS) is good enough that if there is something far out there you want you can. Think cathedral roof paintings, zoos, deer in field. So although not necessary it's great to have the extra reach. Then add the low light into the mix and you finally get a camera that pulls away from all the other PAS. Still the biggest most important draw is both the intelligent auto and superior auto settings. Everyone has some sort of intelligent auto and honestly Sony's isn't the best in my opinion. However the superior auto is a neat addition not generally replicated and in combination with the other features really rounds out the camera. The software in this camera that takes a large amount of the skill involved in other cameras and boils and adjusts everything. I never waste my time with the various scene settings. And that's what I want in a PAS, to turn on, compose, snap, turn off. NOT to mess around with any functions. Ok except when I do... if this is your only camera, and you know a bit about photography you will inevitably come across some shots that both auto modes don't capture to your liking. In those few instances the manual mode gives you some control but not usually enough to satisfy someone willing and able to use those settings. Still I haven't found an attached lens camera that did offer me what I wanted.<br /><br />As your sole video camera. First upgrade to a class 10 sd card, nothing slower or video stinks. Honestly I'm a little behind the times here. I used to use a Sony HDR-HC9 MiniDV HD. I also had one of the predecessors. At the time it was one of the first 1080p and the slow speed replay was great. But I just didn't like the laborious video editing/tape transfers. I know that's a thing of the past but I still don't take two objects when they do mostly the same thing. Any camcorder needs at least 60p (never i) in the quality your shooting, IS, and a stereo mic. The 16x optical zoom on this camera, the stereo mic, the IS, and 60p frames/second mean I'm able to capture video that looks great on my 42in led. Also I take this more places so it's available more. I'm thinking of getting a Hero 3 for my Jeep/Mt Biking but right now this does 75% of what I want for those applications. As a final note remember p not i which is to say progressive interlacing. My opinion is that video should never be shot at i ever. The wavy artifacts make me motion sick whenever someone pans. If your cam only has 1080 60i or 720 60p shoot in 720. Again the concept of quality here with this camera. Lots of PASs have video, heck my phone has video. But none of them have the IS, 16x Zoom, 1080 60p, and low light that this does. That's what makes this a keeper. And at a hundred dollars less than the lowest cost camcorder sony currently offers (in 1080 60p of course) this is a great bargain to include full camera capabilities with real life capable video.<br /><br />As your dslr backup this also rocks. It weighs the same as your kit lens and covers a huge range, so instead of worrying that you didn't bring XX lens just whip this out and get a shot (still not usually THE shot but often close enough). Also as an exploring lens you can take a lot of photos not worry about notes, and get the image data from your ""test"" shots. This can help you figure out what lenses and flashes to bring back to an area and you can time the daylight to work out more in your favor on the return trip too. Then there is the great panorama software. The size and quality of the panoramas are just great. I could get better with a tripod, a tilt shift lens, and a shit load of time, but I'm not even tempted with this great application. Horizontal, Vertical, left or right (up or down) lets you fine tune the exposure (exposure is set on the initial image) and as long as you move slow enough the stitching is fantastic. Finally there is the awesome video capability. Even if you have every conceivable lens and flash for your dslr it will not be set up for video at the same time. This has you covered for impromptu video. Also there are just times you have your biggy in your pack but don't want to seem too intrusive or ""professional"" this lets you keep your expensive stuff in your pack. Oh almost forgot for some of us the in camera HDR of the HX9V is also a nice function. It's quick, easy and can give you a quick idea of what your dslr will get you in post-processing (my dslr body is a little older and doesn't do this in cam).<br /><br />Notes to Sony: Ditch the Background Defocus, phone apps and free software do better and don't take 5 seconds to tell me it couldn't figure out how to do it with a shot. I understand why the flash is there but I still don't like it. I like a more positive two (or three) points of contact on the camera for better stability. Finally I know there's a megapixel war out there but 16mp is too big for such a small sensor, I always have it set to the 10mp size. Love what you're doing with the RX line (bring on the PASs sensor size war!). I hope a 4/3s or 1"" sensors become common on all PASs. If you made an exact spec HX9V with a 4/3 sensor I'd scream like a girl for a week. If you can pack 1080 60p stereo video and between 28-100mm lens on an APS or Full Frame sensor with respectable speed (F2.8 for APS or F4 for Full Frame) in something remotely pocketable you'd have oodles of dslr users banging down your doors for a true dslr backup. Hell I'd have a custom hip holster made for it so I could be the first navy seal of photography. Keep up the progress Sony.",0.9333333333333333,,0.19891761329731256,,PlayStation

"I'm really happy with this inexpensive receiver. With everything being HDMI these days and TVs being incapable of outputting Dolby Digital 5.1 via optical cables (except for over the air broadcasts), I figured it was time to update my 7 year old receiver. I have 4 HDMI components connected to this receiver; HD DVR, DVD player with HDMI output, a PS3, and an Xbox 360. Yes, thats 4 HDMI devices and this receiver only has 3 HDMI inputs. A $12 HDMI auto switch that I bought from Amazon easily and automatically switches to whichever game console is active. This allowed me to save a bit of cash by not having to buy the DH810 model that has 4 HDMI inputs. The DH810 has some other features that the DH510 does not, such as 7.1 sound, but none that I'd really be able to take advantage of, so I decided to save $70 and go with this model. Setup is extremely simple. Aside from the speaker wires, I only have 4 other cables on this unit... 3 HDMI cables coming in and 1 HDMI going to the TV. Navigating the menus, you can tweak setting like individual speaker levels and distance. One complaint I have is the speaker terminals. The front left and right speaker terminals are fine. I can just plug in a banana clip and it's good to go. The center and surround terminals, however, use the older style where you push down on a spring loaded tab and push in the wire. This can be difficult, if not impossible if you have thicker gauge speaker wire. I'm using 14 gauge and it just barely made it. Overall, I'm very happy. The sound is great, there is more than enough power, it's simple to set up, and it's simple to use.

But in the end I just couldn't get rid of the blue.  It's the same blue that you see in ""white"" led christmas lights and ""white"" led flashlights.<br /><br />I tried to deny it.  I set the color temperature to  warm.  I used the advanced settings (nice feature) to pull down the blues, and tried the greens as well.  It started to look ok for scenes saturated with reds and yellows, but for deep blacks and the bright whites the blue still showed through.  Worse yet most any skin color ended up with a slight blue tint.<br /><br />As far at the internet apps go, I'll say they're a nice bonus but don't make this the reason you buy a TV.  The DLNA client worked nicely when you happened to have pictures or videos in an acceptable format.  For Netflix, Pandora etc. a Roku, a Boxee or some other device will give you much more flexibility.<br /><br />My bottom line ... this is a great TV for watching Avatar, Boise State Football, Planet Earth The Oceans, zombies and victims in CSI.  Not so good for viewing living warmblooded humans.",0.6666666666666666,,0.2573148148148148,,PlayStation

"Great sound. Easy to setup. I recommend this unit since it's really great. I gave this 4 of 5 stars because of the following.<br /><br />What I didn't realize is that each of the HDMI inputs has a corresponding input ""name"" like BD/DVD as an example, and that input also has another corresponding set of input jacks in the analog ports... like RCA jacks, or Component, or Composite jacks. The kicker is that if you are using the HDMI jack, as I am, for that input... then it's corresponding analog inputs cannot be used for another device. So HDMI on the blu ray player input means you cannot use the composite inputs for that same blu ray player input name for another device like your game console. The unit will look at one set of jacks only for the named input of the blu ray player. If you see the rear of the device you can see the named input titles on each jack I'm referring to. Aside from that it's a great unit.",0.911111111111111,,0.35416666666666674,,PlayStation

"Let me first give some details, as I find them useful when reading reviews. I power a pair of Sony SS-F5000 speakers with a SA-W2500 Sony Sub-woofer with this head unit. My living room is 12' by 20'. I have a Samsung plasma mounted on the wall and Directv service. This head unit is great! The HDMI switching is great and the four HDMI inputs leave plenty of room for a sat/catv box, game machine, disc player and one more item. The lack of an on-screen display may upset savvy techies, but it doesn't take away from the performance of the unit. The features such as night mode, input naming, auto-level volume and easy sound processing mode changes are great.

"My very first Sony TV and my first LCD (NOT LED) and I was concerned about viewing angle, black performance and brightness for a bright kitchen application. Considered 2011 plasma models from both Panasonic and Samsung but was amazingly turned-off by lots of manufacture defects and, of course, burn-in is still a reality despite improvements in plasma technology. So far Im impressed with the Sony, especially with the price like new $600 shipped for a 46"". Good picture out of the box but Cnet has tweaks to calibrate and I recommend you check them out.  Cnet also found blacks were excellent for a LCD.  No streaming features but then it doesnt have a blu ray built-in either.  A simple and cheap used blu ray player with streaming services can easily be had for $100, I feed the new Sony a Samsung BD-P1600 and it does great.  My initial purchase was a 2011 Panasonic plasma from Kmart (returned three days later for the fluctuating brightness defect) and it sounded better than the Sony.  The Sony gets loud it just doesnt sound as full as the Panasonic.

The digital controls stopped functioning, and while I could do some point and shoot (barely), I couldn't change any functions or review the photos.  NO PROBLEM, I thought, it's still under warranty, but no, it has water damage, no it has humidity damage, no, maybe its heat.  Which apparently voided the warranty.

"I consider myself to be a pretty smart guy.  I finished high school and completed four years off college but it took me two weeks to figure out how to operate all of the set-up features for this device.  I had to read the owner's manual almost daily because the instructions are vague, confusing and not very concise.  Seriously; Sony needs to rewrite this instruction manual.  Once I got through the toil and trouble of learning how to make the receiver do what I needed it to do; I am now pretty much satisfied with it.  I'm very much enthralled with a couple of the HDMI menu features.  PASS.THRU allows me to watch television or play a Blu-ray without having to turn on the receiver at all.  This is possible because the receiver converts into a standby mode allowing all audio to travel out through the television speakers.  This feature is a great energy saver, but it took me a very long time to figure out how to set it up.  One must be very patient - but the benefits received from one's patience are many.  Another groovy feature is one called ARC.  Through the use of one HDMI cable that connects the television to the receiver; you are able to receive clear audio from the television through the speakers connected to the receiver.  I am still reading the instruction manual periodically because this receiver is capable of performing a lot of cool stuff.

"I bought this camera back in 2011 and I still shoot with it nearly eight years later. My previous camera was the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX5V, which was released back in 2010. The HX5V was the first Sony Cyber-shot camera that was capable of HD (AVCHD) recording. Its HD image quality was on par with a dedicated HD camcorder, but I was disappointed with its audio quality. Although it records in stereo, the audio on the HX5V sounds tinny. Since Sony Cyber-shot cameras lack a microphone jack, your audio quality is limited by the internal microphone. Yes, you could use an external recorder to capture higher quality audio to replace the camera's audio, but that is a hassle and that requires the proper computer software. The HX9V captures higher quality audio and images over the HX5V. It can shoot in 1080 60P HD. But the main reason I chose these cameras is for the built-in GPS. Actually, being able to geotag photos with location data is my secondary concern. I am more interested in the camera's ability to automatically synchronize its internal clock with the GPS satellites' accurate clocks. This makes it unnecessary to manually adjust the clock on the camera. If you care about clock accuracy, like I do, this ability is indispensable. I am very disappointed that Sony has mostly abandoned GPS capability in their 4K-capable cameras.",0.9333333333333333,,0.04244505494505495,,PlayStation

"I have owned big SLR cameras and the whole collection of lenses and gadgets. But I wanted a pocketable camera for trips and to have always with me. I want to concentrate on the creative picture taking, not the hardware. This camera has served me well. It does not have all the accessibility (A and S modes, easier manual focus and settings) I would have liked, or things like RAW and a bigger sensor for low light situations or even such simple things like a screw thread for a cable shutter release. But it takes excellent pictures that rival my wife's NEX5. And I love the 16x zoom, the macro focus that can fill half the screen with a penny, and of course the small size and weight. At first I used all the SCN modes which are pretty amazing: panoramas, HDR, low light and anti blur, the hidef movies. I never cared about the pure effects that some cameras have: sepia, B&W, coloring and distortions. The features in this camera use very sophisticated yet useful image processing that expand the situations where you can take pictures particularly with lower light. I have found myself avoiding those SCN modes lately because they do show a processed look. I now use mostly the P mode, and I wish I had more manual control.

I just bought this TV bundled with a PS3 & 2 pairs of glasses.

"ADDED AFTER WRITING THE ORIGINAL REVIEW: There is a way to turn off the power hungry electronic program guide, but Sony didn't make it easy. Search on ""[...]energy star sony hdtv"" (without the quotes) and you should find several postings detailing the saga and the very positive outcome -- thanks to the EPA, not Sony.<br /><br />BEGIN ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />I'd agree with the five star ratings of most others if it weren't for one thing. This TV is supposed to be Energy Star compliant (low standby power consumption) and Sony says the TV draws less than 0.1 watts in sleep mode. I have a power meter and test all new appliances and guess what? This TV draws an average of 15-20 watts when plugged in and supposedly off. (My meter isn't that accurate at these low readings, but I'm confident it's in that range.) Sometimes the meter goes to 0 watts, but that's only for a short period of time after which it consumes about 20 watts. I suspect the problem is with the TV guide the unit gets from PBS stations, which would seem to require the tuner to be on, and 20 watts for that might be reasonable.<br /><br />At roughly 25c/kWh that I pay for my last tier of power, that's about $40 a year of wasted power and corresponding CO2. I tried calling Sony about this to find out if I had a defective TV, or as is more likely, the unit rarely goes to sleep due to the guide search or similar. Initially, they were helpful and said they'd look into it, but I've heard nothing in a month in spite of two emails (plus one just now). I also just wasted half an hour on the phone, mostly on hold. I give up on Sony helping with this, but wanted others to know of this situation.<br /><br />On the positive side, I found buying through Amazon really enjoyable. I called the specialist number they list on the TV's page to find out if there was a coax cable input, and they knew there was one even though the spec doesn't mention it. The TV came within a few days of my placing the order.",0.6888888888888889,,0.12690615835777122,,PlayStation

I am very pleased with my new television.  It has an excellent picture and the remote is easy to operate.  I have other Sony televisions and have never had a problem with any of them.  I am also pleased with purchasing the TV from Amazon.  I had previously purchased TV's for two or three online stores in the New York Area.  These companies immediately called and tried to sell me additional products and extended warranties.  I did not like their hard sell approach.  Buying from Amazon was much different.  Once I made the purchase there were no followup phone calls.  They kept me well informed till the product arrived.  I will continue to support Amazon with other purchases.,0.8,,0.1706439393939394,,PlayStation

"My wife and I were getting tired of juggling a full frame DSLR and accopanying lenses and decided a high-end point and shoot was in order. After a sweep of the internet and stumbling across a dpreview.com review, we decided to give this one a look. We needed something that could compose shots competently as well as take good video, especially with the travel we do and a baby on the way. Here's what we got:<br /><br />Out of the box, the HX9v comes across as a solid piece of hardware. It feels well built, but there's no way you'll mistake it for a slim, ultra-light point and shoot camera. It will, however, fit comfortably in any cargo pockets or loose fitting jeans. The dials and controls are standard fare; my only complaints being in the bad pop-up flash positioning and the small movie record button. We knew about both issues going in, so they weren't an overly rude surprise. I also have to admit being spoiled by my Samsung's touch screen onterface, but anybody who has used a camera in the last decade will be able to utilize the Sony.<br /><br />Firing it up for the first time, users are greeted by the standard OS request for date and time. After that was satisfied, power-up to shoot times were acceptably average in our opinion and certainly not like the horror stories we've heard from other reviews. If I had to sum up my main complaint in that department, it would fall under the header of 'graphical cludge'. Every display has a helpful graphic that ends up sucking away from you photo time. Fortunately, you can disable most of these prompts and I suggest doing so once you are familiar with the camera modes. It doesn't eliminate them all, but what's left is hardly worth mentioning and can normally be forced through by a half-depress of the shutter button.<br /><br />Picture quality was also a concern we had based on some of the more critical reviews we stumbled across. Fortunately there isn't too much to worry about if you're willing to invest a little time into your new camera.<br /><br />On the surface, the critics are right: The HX9v in Auto mode produces good, but somewhat soft and over-exposed pictures. And now the good news: it's almost all completely correctable since the camera has limited manual controls savable to three seperate profiles for your use. Is your picture too soft? Adjust the sharpen setting upward. Too much coloration? You can switch that too. Auto-focus a little too iffy for your taste? Set it to manual. After a few trips around the neighborhood experimenting with the various settings, worries have all but evaporated. To point, we took a picture of the moon last night. Most cameras would either produce a blurry mess or an over-exposed white blob without a tripod. With the HX9v, I was able to take a picture of the moon at full x16 zoom by hand in complete darkness and still get one of the best shots I've seen. The lens stabilization and AF are just that good. Try a hand supported shot in the dead of night with your DSLR and 300mm lens, or even that P&S you have now and you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />1080p @60fps absolutely shines on the HX9v, but you already knew that.<br /><br />The x16 lens has rock solid stabilization and lightning quick focus, adjusting exposure and scene settings seamlessly on the fly. There are several videos floating around youtube and I promise you won't be disappointed if any sort of video production is in your future. With this package you also get an internal stereo mic that works as well as internal mics can. The video is so good that you almost need a professional package to fully utilize it, as opposed to something like Windows Movie Maker. On that note, windows media player doesn't seem to be able to cope so well with the codec and routinely exhibits stuttering on Q6600 4 core machine, but renders finished products just fine. Again, I assume its codec issues more than anything, but just FYI, there's nothing wrong with your camera.<br /><br />Sony doesn't give you a lot of bells and whistles beyond what's already obvious. Panorama shots are nice and can be put to creative use, while post processing filters can be added for more stylistic shots, like monochrome coloring. Smile detection is strong and can even be set to focus on kids or adults, whichever you choose. You can even take 3d photos for your 3d screen, if you happen to have one.<br /><br />Battery life isn't spectacular and video mode will eat it up (processing full HD at 60fps fully stabilized will do that), so you might want to consider an extra battery in your future. Some people have complained about ""ZOMG! in-camera charging!"" and I have to ask them where they've been for the last few years since half the manufactures of P&S cameras routinely engage in this practice. One nitpic I have to make on the topic is that USB charging does seem iffy, like the camera can't seem to decide wether it wants to charge from your computer or not. Fortunately, you can just do it from the wall socket.<br /><br />Beyond that, there isn't much not to like here. It's a solid camera that isn't perfect, but offers you the options to work around most imperfections with semi-manual settings. The lens is great for a camera this size and while it won't replace your full frame DSLR, it offers you enough incentive think about not lugging it around regularly; especially with the x16 zoom and stabilization strong enough to use it. It all comes down to what you want. Pixel peepers will probably want to pass this one up for the Canon SX230 HS. If you need full manual controls or RAW, move along. If you just need great pics and stunning video, this is your stop.",0.9333333333333333,,0.16998325960481928,,PlayStation

"I am pretty upset with the new DSC-HX9V camera from Sony.  i bought it because i was so happy with my dsc-hx5 camera for the past few years.  I find that this new camera has loads of new features, but takes so long to process each picture, boot up and start / stop video that the joy of taking a good picture is reduced.<br /><br />They also moved the location of the movie button to 1/4 inch / 5mm from the upper right hand corner of the phone, where it is nearly impossible to press to start or stop a movie while holding the camera on the right side rubber grip where one is meant to hold it.  if one can get it started and stopped, placing the button there insures that you will need to shake the camera as you shimmy your thumb down the side to end your video.  One would think that the shutter button would start and stop the video like all other cameras, but NO!!! it takes still pictures WHILE YOU FILM... now... that is SUPER COOL, but i would do that much less than just starting and stopping the video.<br /><br />I am really convinced that Sony released the software on this camera before it should have, and needs to spend some time optimizing the firmware and update it.  Either that, or they need to put less features into the camera or a faster processor.  Either way, this camera will probably always irk you as it lumbers along slowly doing it's business.",0.9333333333333333,,0.09626767970857648,,PlayStation

It is unclear whether you would also need an optical input.  The manual attempts to explain that issue but fails to make it clear.  I chose to use it because I had the optical cable, but am not sure that it makes a difference.  The unit set-up menu is anything but intuitive.  The menu is difficult to navigate.  Instructions do not adequately explain each of the menu options, nor the advantages and disadvantages of each.  Because this is a Sony product, much of the manual is devoted to the compatibility of this unit with other Sony products.  There is no way to code your non-Sony TV or non-Sony DVD into this so-called universal remote.

"Our family really loves this TV.  My wife immediately noticed color and black level improvement over our previous displays (two Sony TVs & a Samsung). Definitely a big step up in quality & enjoyment for our home theater.<br /><br />PROS:<br />  MOTION: I really like the motion handling of this display.  I notice more detail and clearer images during fast motion scenes (re-watched Bumblebee & Aquaman on 4K disk and was blown away by how much detail was missed compared to the old TV). Almost gets the balance between smoothness and 'no soap opera effect' perfect.<br />  PICTURE: Color is vibrant with nice saturation, black levels are great, shadow detail is good, the black bars on letterbox movies look great, and the Dolby Vision HDR highlights are really bright (re-watched The Mandalorian: Prisoner episode and was surprised at the brightness of the strobe lights and laser fire on board the prisoner ship).<br />  SPEAKERS: The TV's built in speakers sound great (after a few adjustments of the various settings).  There are simulated surround settings, 7 band EQ slider adjustments, and a Dialog Enhancer setting that acually makes a difference.<br />  AUDIO: (see also cons below) My wife commented how the audio sounded better on our home theater set up. The Dolby Digital Plus output (over HDMI 3 ARC) sounds more detailed on our Sony STR-DN1080 Receiver compared to the Dolby Digital PCM output from our previous 2015 Sony TV.<br />  APPS: The apps launch quickly, menus are responsive, streams start fast, and 4K upscaling of 1080P content looks great too.  I love the Apple TV box, but this TV almost negates the need for it with its very good app performance.<br />  REMOTE: the remote feels good, thin and slim in the hand with nice tactile button pushes, textured plastic back side, brushed finish plastic front side. Note: no backlight.<br />  SCREEN: Zero dead/stuck pixels on my panel<br /><br />CONS:<br />  AUDIO: A squeak noise happens whenever tapping the pause/stop/back buttons during playback of the internal TV Netflix App (Atmos content) over my Sony Receiver/Klipsch speakers (doesn't happen on the TV's built in speakers).  Turning OFF 'Pass Through Mode' in the TV's sound menu seems to have stopped the squeak glitch.<br />  SCREEN: Slight darkening of the corners of screen on while displaying a light solid color (common with VA panels), but this is unnoticeable during actual TV viewing. Not a big deal at all to me, but worth mentioning.<br /><br />NOTES (as of Firmware v6.0132 dated June 2, 2020):<br />  *Movies Anywhere App: supports Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos<br />  *Disney+ App: supports Dolby Vision, doesn't support Dolby Atmos<br />  *YouTube App: supports 4K HDR<br />  *Amazon App: supports 4K HDR & Dolby Atmos, no Dolby Vision.  A few problems I noticed are that the app is slow to load to the home screen, and there is a weird frame rate skip that can be distracting to some on certain selections.<br />  *Netflix App: supports Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos.  The 'Netflix calibrated picture mode' looks too dull in my opinion. It auto enables the light sensor (too aggressively), and none of the settings can be changed within this mode.<br />  *my TV is on a wired 300 Mbps internet connection (for streaming stablility/quality/speed)<br />  *The built in Apps have a unique picture settings memory separate from each of the HDMI input settings<br />  *Dolby Vision picture settings have separate picture settings memory from non-DV sources unique to each input<br />  *I prefer to use 'Dolby Vision Bright' picture setting on all DV supported media, looks great<br />  *The Sanus VLT6 wall mount for the 85-inch tv size is awesome: easy to move around for access to ports & lots of adjustments for changing the position/leveling<br />  *Belkin Ultra High-Speed HDMI cables and Monoprice Ultra High-Speed HDMI cables are used in my setup (at least perhaps until 'Certified Ultra High Speed' cables hit the market)<br />  *After allowing permissions in the Google Home app, Google voice commands can be spoken into the remote to allow control of Nest Thermostat temperature settings. Also, Philips Hue Lights can be turned on/off/dimmed/brightened in your different zones.<br />  *The NEST tv app allows viewing of a NEST doorbell camera on the TV screen (as long as your NEST account wasn't migrated to your Google account).<br />  *The remote is IR out of the box, but BlueTooth mode can be activated in: Settings > Remotes & Accesories >  Remote Control > Connect Via BlueTooth > Connect a new remote > then follow the onscreen directions.  To switch back to IR mode, just repeat the steps again stopping at the [Connect a new Remote].  It seems only one remote can be connected via BlueTooth at a time, thereby setting it back to IR mode.  Remote commands feel more responsive in BlueTooth mode, plus you don't need to point it at the TV.<br />  *Probably because the eARC firmware is glitched or not fully implemented yet (edit: I read responses from Sony reps in the Amazon Q&A section and eARC support will be added as a future firmware update, but I am leaving this information to help others in case they have a similar problem), I encountered the following issue.  My Panasonic 4K Disk Player (DP-UB820) would not operate correctly when connected directly to one of the TV's HDMI ports (with Sony Receiver then connected to HDMI 3 ARC). Sound would stop on Sony Receiver (movie picture still playing, but with zero audio) after using stop/pause/search functions.  Sometimes an error would flash briefly on screen, usually not at all, to ""please use a compatible HDCP 2.2 device on current input"" and then the TV would freeze up, go blank and become unresponsive followed by a screen of black and white horizontal lines.  Next, the TV would turn off and become unresponsive to remote power button commands.  After about 3 minutes or so the TV would reboot showing the SONY logo, the colored Google circles, the Android logo, then finally the home screen again.  Note: Audio signals sent out from the TV through ARC (when it worked) was NOT in Dolby Atmos True-HD (lossless) format, but only as Dolby Atmos Dolby Digital Plus.  FIX: Only after connecting the Panasonic Player directly to the Sony Receiver, then the Sony Receiver to the TV's HDMI 3(ARC) did disk movies finally work with no audio problems or TV resets. Dolby Atmos True-HD (lossless) audio worked great with no stop/pause/search glitches.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: We are very happy with this purchase. This a great TV for the price and I feel it is worth every dollar spent.  Netflix and Movie viewing are awesome and I am looking forward to PlayStation 5 gaming on this display with the future HDMI 2.1 features (4k120, ALLM, VRR, eARC).<br />These 2.1 features will be added to HDMI ports 3&4 *according to Amazon Q&A section Sony Reps.

"Have had my 40V4100 a month now. Had originally wanted the ""W"" with 120 Hz but this ""V"" was on sale locally making the difference $600.  I do not regret buying this 60 Hz set, and saving hundreds of dollars. Overall it is excellent after getting the picture settings adjusted to my liking. Audio quality from the built-in speakers is surprisingly good with the Dynamic mode ON and some extra bass and treble. I do have a minor problem that seems to be common to this new line of Sony LCD TVs - intermittent tiny bright white dots that appear randomly across the picture in a straight line, just a few at a time,  about 4"" below the top of the picture, in HDMI mode only. Most noticeable on dark or black scenes. I almost exchanged the set for another one,  until I saw the same white dots on a 40V4100 at the store playing a Blu-Ray disc. So far Sony's support does not seem to recognize the problem. I hope Sony will pay attention to what their customers are telling them and come up with a fix for this ASAP because it can be quite noticeable on HDMI upcsaled DVD or Blu-Ray sources. If not for that I would rate it a 5.<br /><br />EDIT and UPDATE! Sept 14, 2008 - I am happy to report that Sony has come through and addressed the white dot sparkle problem with an easy to use software/firmware update via a USB flash drive they sent.

"First off, this computer sure does look pretty! However, don't let the looks fool you, this is really not a wise investment. For those looking to purchase a hassle-free all-in-one unit, beware. First off, like another reviewer noted, there is no remote control. You can buy one from Sony after the fact if you would like. If you have ANY intention of playing games on this computer you are completely out of luck. I tried to play Biosphere, only to realize that the graphics card is completely incompatible. What's worse is that there's no way to upgrade the graphics card. You're pretty much stuck with what you've got. Want to play Worlds of Warcraft? Ain't gonna happen. The nice big HD screen sure would be great to use to play your Playstation 3 or X-Box wouldn't it? Yeah, that's not going to happen either. There's no way to connect another source to broadcast to this screen.<br /><br />Want to use Blue Tooth? Better buy an adapter; it's not built in.<br /><br />The pre loaded DVD playing software completely clashes with Windows VISTA, so your viewing capabilities are pretty stilted. You can do it, but it takes a lot of jury rigging to get your settings right.<br /><br />Let's talk about reliability and support. The computer comes with a 1-year warranty with on site service and 1 year toll-free phone support. That sounds pretty good right? Well, my computer failed to boot after a mere 6 months of use. I called customer support and they informed me that I could use a system restore. Problem is....they don't include the disc. Their system restore is stored on a partition of your hard drive. Since that didn't work for me, they informed me I could BUY a system restore disc for the paltry sum of $50 BEFORE shipping. If you're like me and need your computer running 24/7, then you end up paying another $21 for expedited shipping, bringing your total close to $75 for a disc that SHOULD have been included with your product originally. At no point did the technician offer or mention this mythical ""on site"" servicing. I asked what would happen if my hard drive had actually failed, and wondered if there was a Sony authorized service center anywhere......nope you'll have to send it in to their service center and wait 2-3 weeks for them to fix it. Pretty unacceptable if you ask me.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you're looking for a computer that you can have for a few years and continue to use, then you should look elsewhere. It's missing some key features and there's no way that you can upgrade any of the internal components. Personally, I'm kicking myself for not spending my $1800 elsewhere.<br /><br />UPDATE!!!!<br />So as you read above the drive that originally came with the computer died within six months of purchase. Since it was under warranty, they replaced the dead drive...good as new right?  Well, in theory yes, but then a mere 7 months go buy and blammo...drive dies again. Problem is, this time I'm 2 months out of warranty, and Sony won't do a thing about it.<br /><br />Top that off with a CD drive that goes on the fritz every couple days and ends up sounding like a jet turbine engine....whooo you got yourself some quality machinery.<br /><br />Save yourself some serious headache and DO NOT BUY THIS LEMON OF A MACHINE!",0.6000000000000001,,0.05128427128427126,,PlayStation

I wound up purchasing this after months of receiver shopping. I originally started out looking at the Onkyo 609 but the more I shopped the more I tried to reduce my overall costs. I finally settled on this Sony and I am so glad I did. I am not an audiophile by any stretch but I do love this receiver. I have my computer hooked to it as a Home Theater PC as well as my Dish Network receiver. I had an older Home Theater in a Box systems which was sorely lacking since it did not have HDMI connections. This Sony absolutely blows the HTIB away. I just do no see how anyone could ask for a better product for the money.

"This item is TERRIFIC, for the type of TV it is, which is an LED / LCD.  The Picture is sharp, although the remote is somwhat confusing.<br />  LED TV's are more economical than LCD's, and that is the reason I purchased this product.

"The clarity is phenomenal and almost everything works as intended. I have only four major complaints First: The lack of separate Component options there are, ie it's tied into the primarily used HDMI inputs so setting up my console meant I had to juggle the inputs around. I was anticipating I might run into some connection issues, but that was to be expected for the price of the unit. Second: the remote has many options, but if you have a family member who likes to press buttons but don't know what they are doing, it can cause much headache to get set back up correctly. Third: I couldn't get the unit to go into standby when my Samsung TV was off. This isn't a major deal but it is a feature I would like to see with alternate manufactures other than Sony. Fourth: This is almost a two for one deal here. I couldn't get the onscreen display (OSD) for the receiver to work even though I had everything setup correctly, the reason I wanted this to work is because the menu on the front of the unit is a pain to navigate; I spent at least 20min trying to figure out where to change the speaker levels. I am uncertain as to why the OSD wasn't working, it could be related to my third complaint about another feature not possibly working with alternate manufacturers; if that is the case it is a major draw back to the unit.<br /><br />These complaints in the long run are some what minor, what matter is the performance and in every way that matters, it excels. I have it setup for 5.1 and after initial setup, I am very pleased with this unit. I have had it for a short time, but I couldn't be happier with this purchase. I recommend this unit to any one looking to replace their existing equipment at a reasonable price, with above average features, even if not all of them work as intended with other manufactures.",0.911111111111111,,0.04374999999999999,,PlayStation

No led backlighting, no swivel stand, no internet apps etc. just a solid lcd tv with a great picture. I like it just as much as my two panasonic plasmas except for the viewing angles. They are not bad, just not as good as the plasma's. The picture is great right out of the box. Nice and natural.  Believe it or not I couldn't really improve the picture no matter how much I played with it. In the end, I just lowered the color saturation a few notches and changed the tone to warm 1 and that was it. I noticed no motion Blur even though it is only 60hz. This is such a solid set that in this case I feel the old adage, less is more, really applies.

"I got this in the rush of Christmas and didn't even unpack it for several weeks- stupid me! When I finally got around to it, I couldn't get the color right and it wouldn't let me use an HDMI connection, which I found strange. When I finally called Sony, they said they would send me a refurbished one if I sent this one to them- I only had it on a couple of times and didn't think sounded too good.  Well I fiddled around with it and got an HDMI on it and it worked fine, color great; however, when I turned it off and then back on the next day I was back to square one. I took it over to our Mountain house which has Dish and will see what happens next.  I own 8 Sony's between our business and homes and this is the first time I've had a problem.

"Fantastic future-proofed TV for the price! Even though HDMI 2.1 has not been activated yet (It will with a future update), this is still one of the best value TVs you can get with all of these features. If you are interested in gaming's future, including the PlayStation 5 features, then this is the minimum TV you would want to get. HDMI 2.1 will support VVR with 4K 120 (with the right HDMI cable - 48gbps). The only reason why this TV did not get a perfect score from me was because of the slight dark vignetting in the corners which is common with panels from Sony in this price range. Rtings.com will be releasing their review soon and I could already tell you that anything with a score of 8.0 - 9.0 under $2,000 on that website is a really good deal (again whole reviews are really subjective to the viewer since minor things will easily be ignored by actual viewers).",1.0,,0.2295518207282914,,PlayStation
"this boombox is simply amazing. it is much better than last years model which i bought for my dad last year for fathers day. when i first bought this boombox, it was for a cookout at my friend's house. they did not have any cd's and i did not have any ranchero music cd's either. so i borrowed a bunch of my dad and mom's cd's and put them all on my hi-md minidisc player and bought a very cheap wire to connect from my minidisc player to my line-in jack. man my friends were amazed at the sound and the music out lasted the party. when i brought it home, my mom was amazed at the sound and said she was going to buy one too. she never did so i gave her mine one day and tried to see if i can find another boombox out there, but there was no luck. after months of seaching, i came up with another sony boombox, which i called it an experiment. this boombox had a mp3/atrac3 cd player. it sounded good with my 80's hard rock collection. then when my mom would crank up the boombox i gave her, it sounded so good all over the house. i could not stand it anymore and i took off to target to my g500 cuz i really missed it and this time i was going to buy a shelf for cuz before i had the other one on a stool. then i was going to connect everything to it. i connected my playstation2, my directv and the unbeatable reunitement of my sony mz-nh600d minidisc player. nothing out there can beat that combination for the price. i have seen some reviews on this boombox that it can not play cdrw's, well this one plays them fine. i have heard of the bose wave radio at a grocery store and this radio rivals that radio easily. i am not going to say that it beats that radio, but for a much lower price this radio can do more than that radio. the bose wave radio is not portable ha! ha! you can not take the bose radio to the beach or just get up and go to target or anywhere else and buy one like the cfd-g500. the bose radio has not impressed my friends and family either and probably cannot beat my mini disc boombox combinations either. i don't know why sony does not just come up with the name subwoofer. it always has a different name like power drive woofer or super woofer. this boombox has a four inch SUBWOOFER. in the back of this radio there is a port and you can feel all the air coming from the subwoofer. i would recomend this boombox to anyone cuz i am now on my second one and believe me you will spend 5x more for the bose and not even get a cassette player either. also the remote is much different than the one pictured.",0.6888888888888889,,0.2107166666666667,,PlayStation

"I bought this TV just before Christmas 2009 and it has has not worked properly since day 1. First of all, The HDMI inputs didn't work all the time. Periodically when turning the TV on, there is a picture but no sound, or sound and no picture. Reseating the HDMI cable fixes it temporarily. The TV also pops loudly and reboots itself 3 or 4 times a week. Sony farms out repair to a local company and the local guy said Sony has had problems with direcTV DVR's. He called Sony and they authorized replacing the main board and power supply. This did fix the HDMI problems but not the loud popping and reboooting. Another repair call required replacement of the LCD panel. After waiting another 2 weeks for this, the replacement panel wouldn't even turn on so he had to put the old panel back in. Sony then said they would replace the TV and I'd be called within 3 days. This is when the real trouble started. I got a garbled message requesting I fax my original purchase receipt to a toll number in Florida. I couldn't make out the number and the rep left no call back. The next day, I had another garbled message but managed to get the phone number and some of my ""reference number"" out of the message. The next day I got a third call saying the information was incomplete - now they want the retailer's name and address even though the first 2 messages didn't ask for that. Again, no call back number was given. Sony's website doesn't list any toll free numbers, either, so I had to pay to talk to them. That's when I found out the Florida number just bouces to a call center in the Phillipines. Eventually, they got the information (that they already had) and called a week later, leaving another toll number for me to call. This time, they offered to sell me the latest Sony TV at a cost of 300 dollars more OR a refurbished TV. Considering I bought a NEW TV and it didn't work from the beginning, I wasn't too happy. Sony only offers new replacement within the first 30 days, even though any intermittent problem will NEVER be resolved within that time, so everybody gets a used one for replacement. The rep also flat out refused to give me a supervisor, anyone at corporate office or anyone other than him when I asked. Long story short, the ""new"" used TV arrived and broke within 1 day. The picture started out ok, then just got darker and darker until you couldn't see anything. I'm still waiting for the third one.

"I have worked in the field of Image and Video Processing for almost 10 years now and know what good or bad quality image is. When many of my friends say oh good quality of picture, I am like no, there's a dead pixel, there's inaccurate color reproduction, the blacks are not black enough, the colors are too warm, basically I am a stickler for image quality :)<br /><br />I must say this Sony TV has really impressed me. I haven't seen this kind of picture quality with other brands LG, Sharp or Samsung. I think Sony just uses better quality components, which could be one of the reasons why their TVs always tend to be a little more expensive than other brands.<br /><br />We use it as a second monitor for our computers (one Windows, the other Mac) and it does well with text, images and videos. Movies look great and there are tons of settings to play with to suit your tastes.<br />I had to spend sometime initially calibrating it, but once it was done I've never been disappointed with the image quality.<br /><br />I use one of the HDMI ports for connecting my Mac and VGA port to connect my PC. The direct connection to cable also produces excellent pictures (but I guess that partly depends on your cable provider).<br /><br />The swivel feature is very useful. We use it often when trying to watch shows from different parts of our home.<br /><br />The 120Hz refresh is excellent when viewing action packed sequences.<br /><br />All in all a great buy.<br /><br />""Cons"": No internet connectivity options unlike similarly priced LG or Samsung models.

"I purchased this TV because of the LED-LCD screen and size and the price. I found it bundled with a PS3 a 3D transmitter and 2 pair of 3D glasses for one low price from Best Buy. I can not believe the picture quality. This replaced my 720P 46"" Sony Bravia LCD TV that was only 2 years old and the difference is amazing. The 1080P combined with the 240Hz motionflow pro makes football and action scenes in movies look even better. It's like being at the game without having to spend all the time and money getting there and it's better then my local movie theater by far. The picture quality is so good you feel like you are right there experience it in person and not watching from your couch. This is one of the few LED TVs that still has an audio out. This was important to me because I did not want to have to get a new surround sound system too. The four HDMI inputs was important to me too as I have three, one for my directv, one for the ps3 and one for my surround sound/DVD player. On my old TV I had to use a switcher box. The 3D was also a factor in my purchase. My wife hates 3D and will not go see a movie that's in 3D. Now I can buy the movie for cheaper then going and we can watch it in 2D and I can watch it again in 3D. The glasses are a little tight as I have a large head but with the noise piece adjustment I found it manageable. Any small discomfort is quickly forgotten about when you start seeing the picture flying at or away from you. I watched a few movie in simulated 3D but there are more 3D blurays arriving for the holidays, I can't wait to watch those. The remote also controls most function on PS3 too. It wont turn it on but that's OK with me as I only use it to watch Blurays and the TV automatically switches to that input once the you put in a disc. My wife loves that as see now doesn't need to remember how to do that again.<br />If you want to experience TV instead of just watching it then this is what you have been waiting for.

"We love the tv and its functions, but after just a little more than a year, it failed.  I called Sony and, of course, it was out of warranty by only a few months.  They routed me to an authorized repair shop.  This was another nightmare - the shop was not very professional.  They asked for payment ahead of time and then only cash.  On top of that, it took them 3 weeks to repair the tv (total of about 5 weeks out).  They would not bring it back unless we confirmed that we had cash ready to pay for the repair (before they even took the tv out of the truck, the cash had to be paid - thus, before we even knew that the tv was working again).  They did repair the tv though, it seemed.  It cost $300.  According to the shop, it was the video board that failed.  Now, about two months after the repair was completed, the tv has the same problem again.  It manifests by the tv turning itself on and off and then not coming on at all with only the red ""off"" light blinking.  For such an expensive device and the SONY brand, one would expect a whole lot more reliability.  We have several other brands of tvs in our home and have never had any issues.  Sony should be the top of the line when it comes to tvs.  And though one cannot expect absolute perfection, professional repairs by authorized repair shops and not repeated failures are the least a consumer should be able to depend on.

"Picture was fairly good, the sound was even better by adjusting the menu options for sound. To improve on the sound, just turn on the Surround and Bass within the option menu and man it sounds loud and clear. As for the refresh rate, it wasn't great and you get ""ghosting"" alot, even if you adjust the motion. It does improve if you turn off the motion, but then what is the point(because the clarity suffers as well)? Now the truth is that this TV is NOT a true 240Hz (aka trick term: Motionflow XR) tv. It's not Amazon's fault but Sony's trick wording for frame insertion (interpolation) blinking rate. This is mostly likely a 120Hz multiplied at best, 60Hz at worst.

"I'm a longtime Sony product user.  I have had eight Sony televisions prior to purchasing the Bravia KDL32EX523.  I was VERY disappointed with this TV and I returned it to Amazon.  The picture had an overall magenta cast, even when I turned chroma all the way down (to black and white).  Reds were magenta (ever see a magenta Coca Cola can?)  If I adjusted color toward green to ""correct"" the red deficiency, the yellows went greenish.  The picture also lacked snap.  Colors were washed out.  Flesh tones were not natural.  Highlights tended to bloom, losing detail in highlight areas (like faces).  Adjusting brightness, contrast, backlight didn't help.  Could never get a satisfying picture.<br /><br />Also, the audio quality was poor, no decent lows or highs.  Just mid-range.  The remote control was very difficult to use, too difficult to navigate.  The printed instruction manual was very inadequate, basically dealing with initial installation and setup.  Everything else was on-screen.

"Our family had recently purchased the Sony KDL-46EX700 but Sony felt the need to replace that model with this KDL-46EX710. Well the picture quality on the EX710 is not as good as the EX700. I had no trouble setting up the EX700 to produce movie theater quality. Black on the EX700 is black even with the backlight setting at 5. The best that can be achieved on the EX710 is a gray with the backlight setting at ""min"". There is just too much light coming from the edge backlight LED's. This is most noticeable on a letter-box picture where the top and bottom bands are black. It's an annoying glow in the four corners of the picture and it is worst when viewing at an angle.<br /><br />Sony is also trying to cut costs to much on the KDL-46EX710 model when they change the labeling on the back component hook-up panel. On the EX700 TV Sony had an easily readable label showing the different component connection points which was readable from 2 feet away.

"Just as advertised - very good built quality, excellent picture and very easy setup with step-by-step on-screen guidance. Really nice mounting base - solid.  We supplemented it with a ZVOX 670 soundbase that does enhance the audio but actually the built-in sound was not bad. The only issue is that the remote that can learn to control the channel selection on the cable box doesn't always change the channels - this could well be a problem with the cable box and is not a deal breaker.",0.8888888888888888,,0.26575757575757575,,PlayStation
"We have the w900a and the w850a ... both are phenomenal.  Make no mistake about it, the picture on the 850a is every bit as good as it's smaller 900 brother.  In fact, the uniformity is actually better on the larger screen (no idea why as this seems backwards to me).  The sound is also much better on the 850 vs the 900 since it has an additional speaker (3 in the 850 vs 2 in the 900).  I don't notice any difference in response time between the two units.  Visually, the 900 has a slight green border from the cut glass on the edge of the screen while the 850 has a silver steel mesh border.<br /><br />Both TVs are incredible but if you have the room and extra cash, go for the 65&quot; 850.",0.8444444444444444,,0.2611111111111111,,PlayStation
"What can I say, it's a Sony receiver. I replaced a ten year old Pioneer unit with this, and I am so pleased. My rats nest of wires has disappeared now that I only need one HDMI cable running up to my TV. The sound is good through my Bose speakers, and the setup was a snap. I saw that there were a lot of adjustments I could make to the sound setup, but the default sounded great to me and I haven't adjusted it. One thing I like is that it seemed to detect how many speakers I had plugged in and configured itself to work with them. Very nice.<br /><br />It's a Sony, so it will last for years, and the HDMI and 3D capability make sure it won't become obsolete for a good while.",0.911111111111111,,0.3692307692307693,,PlayStation

You can easily connect it but the choices are only fair and you can't add additional features nor does it seem that sony plans on providing additional content.  It is easy to add things like Netflix (for a monthly fee), You do get Crackle for free but the selection is only fair at best.

"I purchased this TV thinking I got a deal. Dont get me wrong, it has a great picture when watching TV at 1080i and Blueray at 1080p,but if you really want 4K, this TV wont do it. Sony negated to mention you would need to purchase a $700 Sony 4K content server to get 4K video and with this you can buy Upscaled 4K content. With Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and YouTube now all streaming 4K, you can't get that on this TV. With the $700 add on you can get Netflix now i was told. The bigger concern and reason I returned mine, A) Delt with Sony Customer support for two weeks, they would not do anything for me, terrible service, never called back when they said they would. Escelated the issue twice with Sony , best they said they would do, $100 off the $700 server box. No resolve, no further escolation, only call center. B) Concern 2, getting a $700 server box resolves problem for Netflix, for now. What about when Direct TV, Comcast and other cable providers unvale 4K content later this year early next. The TV will not be capable of handleing these signals without the HEVC chip and codec. This only comes in new new 2014 models. Basicly you will have a 4K screen that will never play future 4K content. This I found out after the sales reps lied to me and said its the same as the 2014 model 900b basicly with differnt speakers. Your choice, but mine went back to Sony. They might have the worst customer service and retention stratagy in the world. Cheers",0.6888888888888889,,-0.00209090909090909,,PlayStation
"First of all I had a Panasonic 42&#34; 1080p plasma before, which was maybe nine years old. Today I received the 49&#34; X900E. I have NO 4K content presently other than the X900E itself. The digital broadcasts looked maybe an ounce better, but then I have a larger image than before, but the 480i broadcast content was perhaps a shade worse than on the plasma. So I hadn't changed any settings and put in my Lost in Space Blu-ray series which I had recently completed on the plasma. A lot of people think Blu-ray is barely any better than dvd. I have the Lost in Space dvd as well, and it's eons better, but you see some badly done Blu-ray and it skews your outlook. As well, I could see the obvious differences from the couch.<br /><br />So I put in my first Blu-ray LIS disc, in my standard Blu-ray player, with the same 1080p HDMI cable, and I thought I was seeing things. Somehow or other quite few of the brighter characters, such as the people that were green and the robot, looked 3D, or at least quite comparable to those nature videos you see at appliance stores they use to sell tvs with. Again, not all of LIS was that way, but I really was astounded at how much of it seemed to be a layer above the screen and it's almost a wonder it didn't start making me feel sick, seeing as how I'm not used to seeing blu-ray like that. And what happens when I start to change the settings? And then when I start getting 4K devices and 4K cables? Man, you get a Blu-ray disc done well, and buy this tv, and I would think you would see what I saw. I'm really amazed. I didn't even expect 4K everything would look this good, and I have nothing that's 4K but the tv.<br /><br />(edited) Day Two - Hard to believe, but using the very same dvd player I've used just the day before on the plasma tv, now being used on the X900E, this 3D sort of effect is still going on with dvds, though less pronounced and not as frequent, and I really don't know what is doing it, because it happens on both motion and when things are stationary (but again, not all the time). I'm wondering if all the differences between this tv and my old one are accounting for all of this. Oddly enough I haven't seen this occur on anything broadcast, even though it's perhaps a slightly better picture than on the plasma. Is it a combination of the soap opera effect (I'm not even sure it's on), the increase in screen size, and processing, or still other things? Last night I had my new glasses on, and though I barely wore them for the plasma viewing, it didn't do anything like this to that tv. This morning I don't have the glasses on at all and I'm still seeing it on mere dvd.",0.8888888888888888,,0.02899377045718509,,PlayStation
"We considered Samsung C8000, Panasonic VT25 (plasma), Sony HX909 and Sony HX800.<br /><br />Clearly, both Sony's were better than the Samsung's though the Samsung C9000 being only 0.3""<br />thick was very enticing but Samsungs seem over-bright and the picture did not seem natural.<br /><br />The Panasonic plasma VT25 is also a 3D TV. Plasmas compare very favorably to the LEDs. They<br />have richer colors, and very natural pictures. And the 3D was very vivid, more than on the Sony LEDs.<br />But the pictures are less sharp, and plus the plasma picture quality degrades over time, and in about 5<br />years they don't look as good. Though one has to say, that the plasma tvs have become quite thin<br />over time. In the end, we decided to go with the Sony LED TV as they have a longer life, sharper<br />picture, and overall seemed a bit better built, and the quality of panasonic 3D glasses is pathetic.<br /><br />So, that narrowed it to a Sony XBR HX909 and a KDL HX800. XBR is Sony's top of the line TV.<br />HX909 has a full array local dimming, while HX800 edge-lit local dimming. The first gives better<br />contrasts but the difference between the two did not seem so great. HX909 also has a monolithic design,<br />an opticontrast glass panel, and a lighted Sony logo. It's a beautiful looking TV. To compensate, the HX800<br />has a very thin bezel, making it look very sleek, and costs $800 less (we considered 52HX909 v 55HX800.<br />The difference is only the looks. The quality of both TVs is the same. Since the HX800 bundle included a full<br />3D blueray home theatre system as compared to just a 3D bluray player for HX909 (both bundles include the 3D<br />kit), we decided to go for the 55HX800.<br /><br />In almost 3 weeks of usage, we are very happy with its performance. Real 3D content is amazing. It does seem<br />like things are happening right in your living room (including the tiger shark roaming there). The simulated 3D<br />is less impressive. While with 2D bluray movies, the simulated 3D effect is still quite impressive, with standard cable<br />it is not. Sometimes, the eyes can strain while watching 3D content but I think that is an issue of the settings which we are still playing with. You will need the sony wifi adapter to connect the TV to the Internet (any other wireless adapter is not going to work though you can hook it up by ethernet). Once connected, the Internet widgets are amazing. You can directly stream netflix movies on the TV, and they quality is very good, almost dvd quality.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is the best value 3D TV on the market, and close to the best 3D LED TV. We only wish it's colors were as<br />vivid as those of the plasma TVs we saw (herein Panasonic, LG and Vizio plasma TVs as seemed to be better, so it it not a matter of brand but technology).<br /><br />Highly recommend it, and the deal is great too! We bought it from the sonystyle website.<br />Great experience.",0.7555555555555555,,0.3358101045296167,,PlayStation

"I had to replace my Samsung 46"" LCD because my youngest threw a remote at it.  I was disappointed because it was a great TV.  I would have stayed with Samsung but their price premium had gotten too large.  My first foray into LEDs was with an LG55LW5600.  You can read my review...I was not ecstatic.  I ultimately returned that TV (great service from Amazon!) and went back out on the search.  I finally purchased the Sony 55NX72 from my local Sears at a great price.  I'm very pleased.  The viewing experience is different from a Samsung or LG which tends to be brighter, but Sony makes up with a picture that actually makes people look better.  I'm impressed with the warm colors and crisp definition.  One thing I am particularly ecstatic with is how Sony addresses letterbox bars.  They've produced an LED that does not have edge bleeding.  The blacks are really black. Set up was a breeze. Navigation for features is excellent.  The ""General"" setting is generally perfect for all video types.  Lastly, the bezel is stunning.  While not as thin as the most recent Samsung's, Sony designed an elegant bezel that is essentially an extension of the viewing screen.

"I have been looking at this TV for awhile. Then I saw it at Circuit City for over $200 off anybody's price. (Deal no longer available.) Yes, I read about all the folks having firmware issues that affected the usability of the unit, but I figured for the deal I was getting, I could ""deal"" with the headaches of the firmware issues. Well, I came out ahead but just barely. It took four weeks and four phone calls to Sony to get them to send a jumpstick with the latest firmware version. Yes, they will send you the jumpstick with the firmware already loaded. The TV is very finicky about what type of jumpstick (flashdrive) you are using. I tried four different ones and couldn't get any of them to work. (Yes, I formatted correctly, etc., etc.) Also note: the latest firmware version as of this date (11.16.10) is 4.081. Mine had shipped with 3.025 and it was a disaster. It worked as a TV, Blu-Ray worked fine, but any Internet connectivity was a total non-starter. AND, plugging the ethernet cable in would ruin the functionality of the TV and Blu-Ray. SO, do not plug in your ethernet (LAN) cord until you load in the new firmware and you should be good.<br />Again, after loading in the latest firmware you will be good to go on all levels (TV, Blu-Ray, Internet).<br />Great picture, good sound, great to have all this functionality in one box.<br />But WHY, WHY, WHY, does Sony - or any company - insist on releasing product that clearly does not deliver what it promises? I find it tarnishes the brand, and I've personally had enough of Sony from this TV and other experiences to consider other makes first.

"The good - Very good image quality for both stills and video, especially in low light situations.<br /><br />The bad - This is an area that rarely gets reviewed - audio quality for videos. I've owned this camera for several months and I realize now that the audio suffers from capturing low bass without distortion, especially at higher volumes (i.e. concerts). This seems to be a common limitation for any camera that uses mp4 or AVCHD compression format. Also, when there is low bass playing in the background outdoors, this camera doesn't quite reproduce the environment to where you feel like ""you're there"", and the vocal clarity isn't quite up par to where it can rival a good external microphone or a better built-in microphone like the one on the Canon SX1 IS. The overall frequency range is not quite the best I've heard from a point and shoot camera. It still has a ""tinny"" sound characteristic. This becomes especially noticeable when playing the files on a higher end home audio system and even my Klipsch 2.1 multi-media speaker system. Compared to my old Canon SX1 IS, which uses the less-compressed .mov format (which is still my reference camera for audio quality), the sound quality is definitely inferior. I produce videos to eventually watch on my high end home theater system, so audiophile sound quality is a definite requirement for me. If Sony can improve on this, they could have the perfect compact point and shoot camera in their hands. I was hoping that this camera could replace my much bigger and heavier Canon SX1 IS, but still didn't quite make it in the audio quality area. I just wish that for a camera with such amazing video quality, as others have stated, would match it with equally good uncompressed, CD-quality audio. Update 2/8/12: Looking further into this audio compression issue, the audio bit rates are as follows for both channels - 256 kbps for AVCHD at 24 mbps and 128 kbps for mp4 (uncompressed audio is over 1450 kbps bit rate like on the Canon SX1 IS).",0.9333333333333333,,0.20152380952380952,,PlayStation

I was in the market for a new 32 inch LCD to replace my old 32 inch Samsung LCD from 2005.  I really was only going to consider another samsung or a sony, because of how pleased i am with my playstation 3.  I'm going to start by saying that the XBR9 has a nice picture, but thats where it ends.  The TV takes an honest 30 seconds to turn on, had an extremely cheap build quality, pathetic sound, and a design that is just not on par with a comparable samsung. The tv cant even pivot on its base.  The base of the tv is one of the cheapest looking piece of garbage bases that i have ever seen.  The set does not deserve the XBR branding.  In the end when i saw the samsung LN32B640 right next to the XBR9 at best buy there was no comparison.  The XBR looked like it was a VIZIO next to the samsung.

"This receiver has met or exceeded all of my expectations. I used it with a 5.1 Polk speaker setup. There are connections for two subwoofers but you only need one.<br /><br />The sound output is great. The higher sounds are clear with no tinniness, and the bass sounds from the subwoofer really help bring the overall sound to life. Use the Auto Calibration to start, then use the Manual setup to adjust to your liking. I ended up increasing the volume of the rear speakers a lot so I can really hear the sound behind me.<br /><br />The inputs offer both HDMI for newer devices and A/V inputs for older devices.<br /><br />The only critique I have is that there was a quite a lot of setup necessary to get everything working properly. The HDTV setup was fine, just make sure that the input is set to ARC, if your TV offers it.<br />The main difficulty I had with the setup was to get my Wii and Blu-ray player hooked up with the older video settings. First, when I plugged it in, nothing worked. Then, I got the video but no sound, then the sound but no video. I think the receiver may not identify the input at first. Try turning the receiver off and then on again to get it to recognize the input. Also, the input from the TV will be different for A/V input.<br />Once I got both the sound and video working, the sound came through the speakers but only the front ones, not the rear. I tried changing all of the settings on the Speaker settings menu with no luck. The speaker pattern only listed options with two or three speakers so I thought I was out of luck. Then, I spotted a clue in the manual under the Audio Settings. It was the Sound Field. The default setting was 2 ch stereo. I changed it to Multi Stereo and TA DA! It worked great. I learned that there is a difference between Linear PCM (what the TV uses) and Dolby Digital (what the Wii and Blu-Ray player use), which is why the TV had been working but not the other inputs. So to sum up, the process took a long time, but in the end everything works exactly as I had hoped.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this as a first time receiver to anyone interested in having surround sound for their TV, Blu-ray player, or video game system.",0.911111111111111,,0.17296747967479678,,PlayStation

"I sit looking next to my 46V4100 which is about to go back to Amazon.<br /><br />It's a good TV, a VERY GOOD TV.<br /><br />But it's not a great TV.<br /><br />If you are primarily a gamer, get this set.  I played 360 on it and loved it.  Smooth motion and bright, vibrant colors even after using custom settings [use the W4100 settings on avsforum]<br /><br />If you watch mostly HDTV over the air, on cable or via satellite get this set.  It handles HD very well though the ultimate quality will be driven by the source material.  Sharp picture, good colors and solid black performance.<br /><br />If you watch sports in HD, get this set- it's your best bang for the buck.  I watched baseball and basketball and both looked incredible.<br /><br />If you watch SD, get this set and watch your programs in pillarbox mode- the TV can only do so much with 480 lines blown up to fit in a 1080 line space.  I have a 3 year old Panny 720p plasma that handles SD be3teer than this TV, but I expected that.<br /><br />If you want to build a home theater- that's the rub.  The TV I got has uneven backlighting which makes dark screens look like they have small areas of cloudiness.  I see it on credits screens and other dark screens [like transitions to breaks, fade outs] and when I do it drives me crazy.<br /><br />Any other time, I'm ecstatic with this television.  It's a really solid performer and if it wasn't for the backlight issue - an issue I wouldn't notice most of the time I watch the TV - I'd gladly give it a 5 star review.<br /><br />It's that good, and I'm still that torn about my decision to return the KDL-46V4100.",0.8888888888888888,,0.21166666666666664,,PlayStation
"Great picture, great sound, takes up little space... But my streaming through Roku froze one night, and I pulled it out eventually when it wouldn't start back up.

They tried several special parts etc, but couldn't fix it. He told me this isn't the first Sony he's seen that's done this and recommended Samsung or LG.

"Well I did a bunch of research on the different LED LCDs and had narrowed it down to the Samsung and this based on specs. Aesthetics was an important part of my decision because of the way my house is laded out the TV is right there. I really liked the thought of the Gorilla Glass and WOW this set looks amazing even when its off! Especially if you like contemporary styling.<br /><br />In my opinion the picture is amazing, the black seemed darker compared to my old 42"" Sony LCD. The 3D works very well but so far the content is limited. If you have a PS3 there are a couple of games that will blow you away. But I will have to admit it's still kind of gimmicky. For example while its really cool to see the 3D I don't ""want"" to see every movie in 3D. OH, one REALLY nice feature is a complete set of 3D demos. For example video samples of Movies, Games, and Sports from ESPN 3D. Great feature to demo the 3D functionality.<br /><br />I stream Netflix and Amazon Prime and even over the built in wireless has worked very well for me. As well as the built in YouTube client. I haven't messed with the built in web browser but have pulled it up a couple of times and it seemed very slow to pull up Sony's site. But, still cool that its there!<br /><br />The built in iManual is a nice touch.<br /><br />The channel guide for the over the air TV seemed pretty nice as well.<br /><br />One thing not the greatest but no big deal is the first time say you click the home button it can take few seconds to come up. This is like a menu system to select thru all the different built in content.<br /><br />I've had this set for about a month now and have really enjoyed it ON or OFF!!",0.8,,0.26060545935545937,,PlayStation

"I really love this thing, but I had to do some serious research to figure out how to use optical S/PDIF sound with DVI video from my computer. Lots of forums, lots of instruction manual, no real answers. Here's how I did it:<br /><br />I played some music on the computer, plugged my optical audio cable into the receiver and chose SAT/CATV as my receiver source. I hit [INPUT MODE] on the remote until it showed OPT on the display (this might be default?). No video but sound came through. Then I used a DVI to HDMI converter cable and plugged that into HDMI input 3 (the  SAT/CATV input). I got sound AND picture. - both worked! I think the important thing is to establish the S/PDIF audio signal before you give it the (audio-less) HDMI video. When I tried it the other way around, it would show picture with no sound when I plugged in the optical cable.<br /><br />I guess it's kind of a hack, but hey, it works!",0.911111111111111,,0.19015151515151515,,PlayStation

"I have a 52"" Sony XBR3 from 2007 and absolutely love it.  I had researched that set fully, and it was the best available at that time.  Since then, I've kept an eye out for the new sets, and I thought that if I ever were to buy another, I would probably head toward Samsung, with the LED backlights, 120Hz, etc.  So, when it came to buy this 37"" for our bedroom, I started the research all over again.  I saw the TVs in person, and the Samsung, in my opinion, was a clearly inferior picture.  I looked at Sharps, Panasonics, and the plasmas that were available.  In the end, my conclusion was that the XBR6 was the best set available. Yes, a bit more pricey than it's competitors (what Sony product isn't?), but I found it was worth it.  You quickly forget how much extra $ it costs (only, realistically, a hundred bucks or two), but you are reminded constantly when you are watching the TV how nice the picture is.<br />  The set has  a lot of customizable picture options that allow you to significantly change the appearance of the picture to your liking, even more than the XBR3 52"" I have.  No glare, beautiful set.  Can't go wrong.",0.6888888888888889,,0.3628787878787878,,PlayStation
"First of all, I've done tons of researching before settled with this TV. The brands I've considered are Samsung, Toshiba, Mitsubishi and of course Sony. I'll list the reasons why I end up choosing Sony.<br /><br />1. Picture quality. This set has a jaw dropping HD picture quality, and its BE2 engine does an excellent job processing non-HD signals. The highly rated Samsung's A650 also has excellent picture quality, but have to compromise with its reflective screen. Why deal with reflections when you can have a non-reflective screen with just as good pictures?<br /><br />2. Sound quality, this is by far the best sounding LCD TV in the crowd I've been researching for. Most people own a theater sound system, so they think this is a non-issue. I own a theater sound system too, but I only turn it on when watching DVDs or play certain games. It is just not as convenient, and power efficient to have just a single TV running. So sound does matter.<br /><br />3. TV Guide, nice touch, great for users without a cable box, none of other brands have this feature yet, except maybe Mitsubishi, but not nearly as nice.<br /><br />4. PIP and P&P, this feature is available even in composite video and S-video, unlike Samsung, its PIP available only in PC, HDMI and Component inputs. Similar models from Toshiba and Mitsubishi don't even have PIP.<br /><br />5. Good Value. Sony 2008's TV line up has significantly priced lower compare with its previous models. The V series represents the best value in its lineup. The S series is cheaper but lacking BE2 video processing, TV Guide, and P&P(Picture and Picture), just to name a few. Move up in the line up you get W series with 120Hz. 120Hz is really more of a hype than anything else. This set is already equipped with motion flow and 24P True Cinema, 120Hz make little to no difference.  It does not seem to justify the extra $300+ premium. If you absolutely want this latest technology, go with the W or Z series.<br /><br />With all the features you need, and excellent picture quality and sound, you can't possibly go wrong with this Sony set.",0.8888888888888888,,0.3499664224664225,,PlayStation

Hellooooo marketing fools, guys don't want PIP so they can do their taxes and catch up on facebook while watching TV, they want it to keep track of two programs at once.

"Well I've had my new TV for about a month now and it works as advertised. Excellent picture and vary fast refresh rate so no smearing during high rates of picture movement. I've played with most of the settings and right this moment I'm just using the standard display. I have used the 15 pin D connection to display HULU from my laptop and it works very well. I've also played with the sound settings and after using steady sound and clear voice went back to just standard settings. Music is very negatively impacted by using these setting to the point that movies especially have a very flat sound to them making it feel like your watching a pre-relase take before the music background was added.<br /><br />One thing that most people not having had a wide screen TV before should be aware of that without getting the HD feed you are losing a good portion of the reason for getting a TV of this type. I was using normal cable connection with just a standard feed and the TV display looked like crap most of the time. There were a few stations that came in Ok like the PBS type who mostly displayed HD as a normal course of programming but most of the channels you had to make up your mind if you wanted to watch bloated people or use other settings that either cut part of the picture out or use a standard setting that gave you a small 4:3 screen. While this might seem like a very basic problem to people who have had HDTV's for a long time this was my first one I've had and the results were not good. I solved this issue by going to Direct TV and getting their HD and DVR package. A world of difference. I was able to crank the display up to it's full 1080p with outstanding results. I've been with Time Warner cable for about 25 years and was tired of it's programming anyway so it presented a good excuse to finally get away from them. We shall see how this works out. This isn't a plug for any satellite company just the one that seemed to offer the best package in my area at this time.<br /><br />This TV is not internet ready but with the ability of the set top box I have and Tversity media server software (free version) on my PC and laptop I am able to look at videos and pictures without having to connect directly to the TV. You do need though a set top box that can connect to the internet so it would be mostly the higher end ones offered by the company you chose. I moved my modem and router and sat them right on top of the set top box. It's a big rats nest of power cables now but I'm thinking about making some enclosure to hid most of the mess. This is one of those things where one thing leads to another. Getting a HDTV is a big change in your viewing experience and it causes some changes in how you set up things.<br /><br />One other issue that has nothing to do with the TV as such but has effected both my wife and me is the extra work your eyes go through watching a wider screen. It really gives the eyes a work out so expect to have very tired eyes if you watch TV for an extended time. One other issue was how bright the TV is at night. When a mostly white screen pops up it really can make you squint. This TV has a low light setting so it sets the brightness down at night but it still can hurt you eyes sometimes. There is a custom setting where you can play with all this picture settings but after spending a week or so trying to get it just right I went back to the standard setting. I might revisit this as I become more familiar with the whole setup I have now. Going to HD feed seems to also helped the whole experience and made it much better. So it's like anything else garbage in garbage out. You need an HD feed to really take advantage of this HDTV set.<br /><br />I have noticed that on this size TV that the speakers are not the best. It really shows up in the music channels and doesn't seem to have much dynamic range and has a little in a barrel sound sometimes. Another thing that you should have if possible is a 5.1 speaker system to take advantage of what this TV can put out for a sound signal. Our room is really too small and I'll be sticking with the speakers built in right now. I have noticed that the steady sound still doesn't do too much to cut down on the very loud commercials. I'm hoping the law that is going to be passed if it isn't already to limit sound spikes in commercials will take care of this issue, one can always dream :-). Like I had mentioned before with both steady sound and clear voice music is badly impacted but voices are easier to hear.<br /><br />The smallness of the room also dictated the selection of the screen size. I was pushing for a 37 inch but my wife didn't want something peeking over the window sill, women what can you do, LOL. It did turn out to be a good choice though as anything bigger and we would really have worked hard to catch all the action going on in the whole screen. I'm only about 7 or 8 feet from the screen so it covers most of my forward field of view which is very sufficient for us.<br /><br />So to sum it all up get this HDTV if you want a real HD experience and you have a small room that you need to fit a wide screen TV into. Plus remember you really need a HD feed to take advantage of a TV like this.",0.7777777777777778,,0.18707094959195786,,PlayStation

Bought this camera for a trip to Disney World in August. Purchasing the camera from Amazon was a pleasant experience and I am pleased with the service I got from them. Once the camera arrived I took the time to read all literature as well as only using Sony disks in the camera.<br />The problem started after using the camera a few times (2-3) when trying to access the disk (remove the disk from the camera) the disk access door will not open. The first few times after it started not opening if I continued to try (4-6 times) it would finally open.<br />I was able to shoot my vacation but the last disk took 3-4 days for me to finally pry out of the camera nearlly breaking the door off to get it.<br />I will be sending this back to SONY for replacement or a refund (doubtful) as I'm sure they will FIX it a (Brand New Camera) and send me back a repaired suspect piece of junk.<br />A $600.00 camera shouldn't act up and break down within 1-2 weeks after receiving it. I thought SONY was a good product untill I bought this camera. My next purchase a Wide Screen HD TV won't be a SONY thats for sure.,0.7111111111111111,,0.1125781625781626,,PlayStation
"If you're looking for an LCD/LED, you can't go wrong with Sony's Bravia KDL46EX710. The picture quality is very solid, especially for gaming. My only complaint is that the picture isn't always consistent for viewing movies. The sound quality is very passable for the small rear facing speakers, but I would strongly recommend purchasing Sony's HT-CT150 sound bar to compliment the system.<br />This T.V. is a constant showcase to my friends who are always envious and wanting to upgrade to something like what I have. Gaming truly shines on this television. If you've ever tried a game on another set, this T.V. will most likely blow it out of the water. I've heard of people complain about motion blur, but I've only spotted it occasionally on blu-ray's during fast action scenes. And it was not nearly enough to ruin the experience. I love it, my girlfriend loves it, if you're on the fence about this product....GO BUY IT!!!",0.8,,0.09570932539682539,,PlayStation
"If you're looking for a great 37 inch HDTV, there aren't many choices.  I found Samsung, Sharp and Sony as the highest rated in this size.  Unfortunately all the best technology is only available at 40 inches and up, so you will be making some sacrifices to stay under 40"".<br /><br />PICTURE QUALITY<br /><br />One of the factors that influenced my decision was an Amazon review for the 37"" Samsung, which compared it to this Sony and claimed the Sony was 120Hz.  Let me make it clear -- this TV is NOT 120Hz.  It is 60Hz.<br /><br />Due to the fact this TV uses 8-bit processing instead of 10-bit, there is major banding of gradients.  As a web graphics professional it is extremely obvious to me, to the point of being annoying and distracting when there are scenes that have strong gradients.  But I may be more sensitive to this due to my profession.  Had I known that 10-bit processing alleviates this problem I would have made that a must-have feature for my TV purchase.  Other than the banding issues, I'm very happy with the picture quality.<br /><br />INTERFACE<br /><br />The interface for the TV is sensational.  Very adjustable, and very sexy and enjoyable to use.  The only nit is the interface for changing inputs.  If you are using a TiVo remote, you will find it tedious.  Pressing the input button will first show you a menu of all possible inputs. The one you are currently on is highlighted.  You must hit the input button again to highlight the next input.  Then you must wait a few seconds, and the TV will select the new input.  The interface insists on showing all possible inputs in the menu -- and there are ELEVEN!  Unused inputs are grayed out and cannot be selected.  Still, it's extremely annoying to see ELEVEN inputs when I'm only using two.<br /><br />HARDWARE<br /><br />The bezel is nice and thin, which means this TV doesn't take up much space for a 37-incher.  The Sony styling is very appealing -- much nicer than the best Samsung and Sharp in this size.  However, the status lights ( in the clear area below the TV but above the speakers ) are almost impossible to see in a well lit room.  It takes a while for the TV to turn on and it makes no sound when powered up.  Without the feedback of a green light, it can be difficult to tell if you've succeeded in turning the TV on.<br /><br />The TV is also quite thin and light.  I had no problems mounting it on a stand myself.<br /><br />EXTRAS<br /><br />It supports Bravia Link, which makes life with my Sony DVD player a lot easier.  By using an HDMI cable, the TV is able to control the DVD player.  The DVD player turns off and on automatically as needed and the TV remote can play, pause forward, etc.  One less remote on my coffee table.  Wonderful!<br /><br />This TV is also has a DMEX connector, so you can use all the latest pricey add-ons that Sony is making, like the Internet Video Link.<br /><br />REMOTE<br /><br />The included remote is one of the nicest I've had with a TV in a long time.  It looks beautiful, is simple, nicely sized, and doesn't feel cheap.  I only use the remote when I want to watch a DVD, so I may not be the ideal candidate to speak about the remote.  I did notice the channel and volume buttons are placed quite low and far away from the circular directional control.<br /><br />IN SUMMARY<br /><br />You make sacrifices today when you get a TV under 40 inches.  There's a lot to like about this TV, but it seems that the Sharp Aquos LC37D64U has 10-bit processing which makes a significant difference when there are scenes that require lots of subtle shades of the same color.  This TV doesn't handle those kinds of scenes well -- lots of banding.  I haven't seen the Sharp myself, but based on the tech specs I would advise anyone looking for a TV in this size and price range to check it out.",0.6888888888888889,,0.11259995791245792,,PlayStation
"I bought this TV as a Christmas Gift for my husband and I.  I spent months researching TVs and I learned a lot by doing it. I was tossed between the Samsung and the Sony. What did it for me was my son-in-law bought us a Sony DVD Surround Sound System and due to compatibility I decided on the Sony and I'm glad I did.  I'm in awe of this TV. Everytime I watch a Hi-Def TV channel I just can't believe the picture quality!!  It is nothing less than STUNNING!!  Having a Sony DVD and TV allows us to use either remote to work the volume control.  If you have a different brand of sound system I don't know if that's possible.<br /><br />We are both over 65. I'm computer literate whereas my husband can barely figure out how to program our clock radio!!  I wanted a Tv that wouldn't be complicated for him and this Sony TV fits the bill.  It's very user friendly. There are still some things he can't do, but mainly due to his stubborness to learn new things!!<br /><br />We have a router two rooms away from the TV and yet we get a strong wireless signal using a cheap-O router.  We are so enjoying streaming video from Amazon. As a Prime Member we get a lot of video for free.  We just watched 3 seasons of Sons of Anarchy on Amazon and we only paid for Season 3.  One and Two were free.  We saw great moves for free too.  There are Widgets built into the TV for Netflix, HuluPlus, YouTube, etc.  But we're happy just using Amazon. (As an aside, I wish Amazon would offer a monthly subscription for their pay videos (like Netflix) insteading of paying for each separately, but there are enough ""free"" videos to keep you happy for a long time without paying a dime as long as you have a Prime membership.<br /><br />We are so happy with this TV.  We've had it for almost a month now.  We haven't used the 3D yet but sure we will sometime in the future. It is a downer that Sony doesn't give you the glasses but as 3D gets more popular they will probably drop in price like everything else after it's been out awhile.<br /><br />My recommendation:  Buy this TV, you can't go wrong and you will be happy!!",0.8,,0.2791044372294372,,PlayStation
"Just bought this TV and have had it for just over two weeks now.  It's fantastic.<br /><br />I spent the last couple of months reading reviews, from Amazon, CNET, other sites. I had it narrowed down to the Samsung, Sony and Panasonic Plasmas.  After looking at all of the side by side, the samsung picture quality just wasn't on par with the Sony or Panasonic. However, of the two sets, the panasonic has a slightly better picture quality... but it's really only noticeable when looking at them both side by side. I didn't want to pay a $1k more for the panasonic - so I got the Sony and the Sony soundbar for the same price.<br /><br />Picture quality on the Sony is increadible.

"I've had this television for a week and a half now and couldn't be more pleased with it. I originally purchased the Vizio E701I-A3, but returned it after a month. The Vizio was a decent TV, but the picture washed out quite a bit when viewed from even a slight angle and it just wasn't an impressive picture. The picture quality of this Sony TV on the other hand, is absolutely stunning! It seems so lifelike. The Triluminous display is a real treat to watch. I don't know how Sony pulled it off, but the colors are fantastic. The display produces great flesh tones while at the same time making things like blue skies, green vegetation, colorful flowers, etc. look so vibrant, rich, and well, lifelike. The TV also has great blacks and handles motion really well. I used the Disney WOW calibration disk to adjust the display and only ended up adjusting the hue three clicks in the green direction, everything else was on the money right out of the box! I'm usually a bit sceptical about marketing statements like the one Sony has for this television ""Introducing a picture so lifelike, it's like looking through a window"", but I have to say that this statement sums it up quite well! The smart features are plentiful, work well, and the menus are well organized. It comes with two different remote controls, one is very simple and elegant, and the other has all of the bells and whistles. I can't say how well the 3D functions yet, but if it's on par with the rest of the TV, it will be top notch. The digital tuner is quite sensitive. The Vizio could find three stations, but this Sony found eleven. Both TVs were hooked to the exact same outdoor antenna. The only negatives I've found so far are the fact that you can't access the TV settings menus while using the Netflix app and the sound. The sound isn't bad at all, but it lacks a little in the low end, but I'd expect that from such a slim TV with downward firing speakers. I use a 7.1 surround system anyways, so for me it wasn't even an issue. Even if I could only use the built in sound I'd purchase this TV, the picture quality way outweighs any deficiency in the sound. I was thrilled with this TV from the first moment I powered it up and can honestly say that I like it more and more everyday!!",0.8444444444444444,,0.1968112244897959,,PlayStation
"Ive had this for a few years now, and combined with my BIC Venturi speakers its a great buy. Easy to understand menu, lots of inputs for my pc and other peripherals, but I do have one issue. When I try to use the RCA inputs with an mp3 player or ipod, the sound is all wrong. Very faint, lots of reverb, like im only getting part of the signal? So instead I play music through the HDMI to my pc. Other than that, i'd get another.",0.911111111111111,,0.0037037037037037277,,PlayStation
"This TV is stunning. The picture, its colors, and depth are incredible! I'd give it 6 stars if I could. The newer generation models from SONY look nowhere near as good as this particular 55"" LED. It looks super modern and squared. The front gorilla glass just adds a kick to make it look even better. If you're into iPads and other Apple products, shape-wise, this TV fits right in. THIS IS THE BEST LOOKING LED TV EVER PRODUCED, PERIOD. It's more than just a TV, it's a marvelous piece of furniture.<br /><br />In the last few years, I owned several Samsung LCD's and more recently a 7 series 55"" Samsung LED. None of these, not even the LED, can compare, let alone rival the SONY in overall picture quality and smoothness.<br /><br />So, take the few negative reviews here with a grain of salt. As with any TV, there are small imperfections with the early models. However, manufacturers always make revisions and improve on a given TV, which is why some folks experience issues that others - mostly in the later stage of production - do not. Case in point, I see none - and I emphasize NONE - of the bleeding or ghosting problems some people reported. Also, this TV works beautifully with my PS3. Both games and DVD/Blu-ray look breathtaking! I never once experienced a hiccup or flickering like I have with the Samsungs.<br /><br />True, it lacks some features and some of the apps look half ass. But it's not like the Samsung ones are any better!! People who complain about features, or lack thereof, should only comment if they owned a Samsung. Personally, I think too many folks are jumping on the wagon with new generation TV's with the expectation that it's going to magically replace their PC. It won't. At least not for another 5-10 years.",0.8,,0.2892128126503126,,PlayStation

"If you have any doubts because of the price...doubt no more!!<br /><br />As a proud owner of the DH520, i can gladly tell you that even though the price tag is somewhat low for what the 520 offers, this product delivers!<br /><br />No complaints!<br /><br />Great job Sony",0.911111111111111,,0.35000000000000003,,PlayStation
"My family had owned some Sony products over the years, mainly the first two PlayStation game consoles and some cameras and camcorders. But, I feel like I'm the first person in my family that actually owned a TV from the company. Sony really outdid themselves with this Bravia model. Not only is the picture incredibly lifelike, but the sound is great too. Whether you're watching anime on Funimation, a movie or original series on Netflix, or regular TV - or you're gaming on your favorite console, the picture is fantastic.<br /><br />As my parents and sister are still Vizio users in their respective households, nothing comes even close whenever it comes to lifelike colors on TV. If you're in the market for a new TV, I'd definitely recommend this one.",1.0,,0.192825311942959,,PlayStation
"nice tv... you need to read the reviews and the manual in full.  everything works, youtube, etc. i got it super cheap and it came in two days using the free ground service.  i am not tv expert or trained video technican.  but with a little twinkering it is a nice set up all around... cant seem to get the cc to work, but oh well, still testing it out",0.7555555555555555,,0.356547619047619,,PlayStation
"I purchased this 46 inch tv to replace a 6-7 year old 42 inch Sony LCD tv.  There is a small improvement from one to the other, as far as pictures go.  The way I understand it, the more significant improvement is with the thickness of the tv (or lack thereof) and the long-life of LEDs vs. regular lamps.  The sound quality of my new tv is not as good as my old one, perhaps because of the thinness of the tv and speakers.  Another difference between the two is that the new tv is 1080p, while the old was 780p/1080i.  I do not think that this is a big difference, at least for this size of tv.  The new tv also has some fun internet ""gadgets.""  They actually work quite well.  I expect, however, that we will not use them very often because our Directv DVR usually has many tv shows saved.  I can see us using it to watch old movies for free, or to rent new movies on-demand through Amazon.  Then again, Directv has many of the new movies on-demand too, although they cost a dollar more.  Overall, I have been, and continue to be, very pleased with these Sony tvs.",0.8,,0.1821316614420063,,PlayStation

"The picture quality of this TV is unreal. I have to 2 other Sony LCDs, a 32 and 40 inch TV. This XBR make them look like piles of garbage. Don't even consider buying anything else other than a SONY XBR series.",0.6888888888888889,,-0.125,,PlayStation
"This is our first camcorder. Admittedly we were intimidated by all of the choices and formats on the market.  This DVD camcorder is a wonderful option because you do not need to use a computer or any additional equipment to watch your movies.  If you do desire to do editing with your PC, you can do it with a usb port and unlike many other camcorder formats you do not need a firewire. We have a DVD player (not even a new or fancy one) and we are able to pop the DVD right from the camcorder into the DVD player and watch it right away - no extra steps.  There is no need to plug the camcorder into a vcr or tv to play it if you have a dvd player.  To us that made it worth the extra cost beyond that of a minidv camcorder.  In addition, the DVD media is a lot more permanent than most tape formats as a DVD will last a much longer time - no need to transfer it into another form for archiving.  The DVDs can even be played on the sony playstation game players.<br /><br />If you don't want to buy a lot of extra equipment for a computer and you want instant gratification where you can view your movies quickly and archive them without hassle, this is the camcorder for you!",0.7777777777777778,,0.2289188881294144,,PlayStation
