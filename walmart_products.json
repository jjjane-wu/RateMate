        "text": "I really love this phone! I ordered it from Walmart online as a new phone, and it came with its own SIM card and a charger cord. The charger cord was an iPhone to C charger cord and though and I didn't have a base for that kind of cord, I had also ordered a regular iPhone to usb cord to fit my current base since I wasn't sure if it came with one. I've had this phone for about 2 months now and it works great! Data and WiFi network are fast as are the apps. It was super easy to set up and get my current number added to it. I even dropped it in the toilet on accident a few weeks after having it and it still works perfect! It is small, compared to a lot of the other phones on the market right now , but that is one of the reasons I love it, and it fits perfectly in my pocket. I also love that it still has a home button which is hard to find on an iPhone these days! I looked it up, and the iPhone SE 3rd generation came out between the iPhone 13 %26 14. So this is a relatively new model and it was only $150! Can't beat that price! All in all, this is a great phone for the price. I love the fact that it has a home button, is easy to use, and wasn't super expensive.",

I am so disappointed that they cannot be straight and tell me that they do not have in the store but can ship. I would have picked the shipping option and had on time if that was the case. Do not believe that you will get this item in the store, even if they advertise it that way. Shame on you Wal-Mart for false advertisement!!  :(",

It's slim, lightweight, fast, has good software and excellent battery, which combine to make it a perfect choice for me (small business owner, light creative work %26 working from anywhere).  As it's an older model, many stores won't have this available, and certainly not at this price-point.

After waiting almost 4 weeks and still not having a tracking number, I reached out.\nThey did refund me quickly, stating a \"price glitch\" but based on other reviews I assume there was no glitch, they just don't actually have the product.",

When I unboxed it I found that Walmart had sent me a Japanese Nintendo switch, nowhere online did it say the model I was purchasing was a Japanese version. Now I have to have my wife who I bought it for and is in another state trying to and exchange it at the Walmart by our house. By false advertising Walmart has just caused a major headache for us especially if they don't allow an in store  exchange because it was bought online. I'm never using Walmarts online website for big purchases again after this. I might have to pay a little extra at Best Buy or Target but at least I won't have to worry about false advertising.",

This is cheap.\n3.- They sell this product as Core i7, 3.5 GHz processor, SSD, MacOS Catalina. I received a Core i5, 3.1 GHz, Flash Storage, MacOS High Sierra. \nI mean, overall, I can see based on similar comments how these \"sellers\" can cheat using Walmart to take you for a ride. Stay away.\nReally disappointed.",

        "text": "Getting Macs refurbished is a bit like Russian Roulette...you can luck into some really good items, but then you can end up with some really crappy ones. I have had both experiences, so I was not sure what to expect. There was a quality rating image on the product description page that showed the condition as \"excellent,\" and between that ant the price, caused me to take a leap of faith on this one. \n\nI received the MacBook Air and have been using it for almost a week and I am very satisfied with it for the most part. It came in excellent condition as stated. The box it came in protected it well, and it had very light signs of use on it. I cleaned it up a little and it looks almost brand new. It was important to me to get a 2020 MacBook Air because that one can be updated to the latest release of MacOS as opposed to previous versions which can only go up to Sonoma. I was able to upgrade this MacBook Air with no issues.\n\nIt works great! I was most worried about the battery, as most refurbished MacBooks have worn-down or bad batteries, but this laptop has a battery reported as normal by MacOS. It holds a charge for a very long time and I can use it on the battery with no issues. It also comes with a new condition USB-C charger that works fine. For the price, this was a really good deal...except for one issue.\n\nThe listing states that this is a MacBook with 256GB of storage space, which is great, and part of the reason that I got this particular laptop. But when it arrived, I found out it was only 128GB of storage. That is not awful, as all of my most important apps fit on the hard drive and I keep my documents in the cloud so I save space. Still, that is only 1/2 of the advertised capacity. \n\nWeighing everything, given the fact the laptop was fine everywhere else, I decided to see if I could reach out and get a partial refund to compensate me for the fact that I did not get the advertised storage. I did not want to have to go through the full refund process only to have to reorder a different laptop and potentially get one that had more storage but more issues, too. Walmart informed me that they could not do a partial refund, only a full refund and then I would need to reorder the laptop on my end. They did offer a discount if I went that route, but I did not want to send the one I had back.\n\nI reached out to the seller directly and have not heard anything back from them yet. Because the laptop I got is so good otherwise, I can work around the incorrect storage issue, but for another user that may have been a dealbreaker. So the shipping was fast, the laptop looks and runs great, but the incorrect storage detracts from my rating. Still, I cannot say the experience was a bad one this time around.",

I've had Straight Talk for years and have bought phones online in the past with no problems, until now. After three frustrating days and numerous phone calls, a representative told me to take it to a Walmart store and have them scan it, then it can be found in the system and activated. I didn't see how that would work as the phone was not FROM the store, if you understand how their inventory works, but it was worth a try. Luckily this phone model was in their system. They processed a refund for the phone, put the money on a gift card, and resold it to me, this process of course included scanning the bar code of the new phone, and, there you go, it was now able to be found by Straight Talk when I called to activate it, so it does now work. This whole process was aggravating, stressful and completely ridiculous. Absolutely inexcusable that a phone, which by the way, claimed to be 'locked to Straight Talk' both on the website AND the material that came with the phone, could not be added to the advertised carrier without jumping through many, many hoops. Crazy! I will never buy another phone online. The phone itself is fine, but the whole customer experience was a -10.",

        "text": "Well, honestly, I gotta say, from ordering the PS5 to having it shipped to the store so nothing would happen to it, I just hooked it up a couple of hours ago. I gotta say, PlayStation has come a long way. I am really digging the system, and to be honest, I just got the Xbox Series X in December. I can't really decide which is a better system, honestly, but as of now, I'm digging the voice feature on the controller very much. It is so nice; I don't have to buy a headset for the PlayStation. I can use the controller itself for communication. But not only that, I could go ahead and tell the PlayStation to shut down with the controller hands-free. I really love the operating system, and I feel it's a little bit more organized than the Xbox. As for the graphics, I don't know yet because I'm still downloading some games, so tomorrow, that's when I'll be able to really tell the difference. But regardless, I'm happy with the system and my experience with Walmart",

I'm hoping this item wasn't returned and works properly because I intend to give it as a gift. Walmart needs to make sure online shoppers aren't being shipped open items because we do have options to return the item and prefer not to have to be bothered with the hassle of standing in a long line to return something that should be sealed and unopened. Its an inconvenience and it defeats the purpose of online shopping. Something that cost almost 500 dollars should be sealed and new. I'm hoping this works because \nI don't want my child to be disappointed on Christmas Day. This seems to be an issue another shopper had as well. This will be my last large purchase from Walmart due to this disrespectful move on their behalf. Items shipped to customers need to be new unopened and sealed, not damaged on the box and opened. This was not damaged during transit. It was placed in the box like this.  I didn't pay for an open box item and should not have received it in that condition.",
